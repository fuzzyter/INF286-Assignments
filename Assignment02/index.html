    <h1>Desert Survival Game</h1>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>It is 1:00 p.m. on a Saturday afternoon at the end of May. You and your teammates have just finished a two-day
        training in Casablanca, Morocco. You are all on board a chartered, twin-engine plane that is destined for
        Dakhla, Morocco, a small town on the coast of the North Atlantic Ocean, approximately 1500 kilometers from
        Casablanca.
        <br><br>
        At the beginning of the flight, the Captain came on the overhead speaker and invited you to sit back and relax
        during the two-hour flight. The first fifty minutes of the flight were fine. Around this time the pilot comes
        back on the speaker to let you know that you are currently flying over the Sahara Desert and that weather
        reports showed a temperature high of 47 degrees Celsius.

    <h2>The Crash</h2>
    <p>Approximately one hour and ten minutes into the flight, you hear a loud blast, and the plane nosedives. Within
        minutes you realize that the cabin is losing pressure. When you look outside the windows, you notice that the
        desert below is growing larger as the plane rapidly descends toward the ground. You notice that the only things
        you can see out of your window are some large boulders and miles and miles of sand. The pilot comes on once
        again to let you know that the plane has blown an engine and is, therefore, indisputably, going to crash and so
        all on board should prepare for a turbulent, possibly fatal, crash landing.
        <br><br>
        "Brace, brace!!!" - the captain says.
    <h2>Aftermath</h2>
    <p>Within minutes the plane crashes and smoke and flames fill the cabin. All surviving passengers and
        crewmembers scramble to exit the plane before it explodes. Seven minutes after the crash, the plane explodes in
        a fiery ball that reduces it to rubble. With the exception of the airplane's captain and one crewmember, you,
        your teammates, one flight crewmember, and the co-captain have all survived the crash. Now you must decide how
        to work together to survive the desert climate and terrain, get help, and hopefully make it out of the desert
        alive. On your way off the plane, in the few minutes before it exploded, you and your teammates were able to
        salvage the items in the list below. It is May and you and your teammates are dressed in business casual for the
        hot summer months of Africa.
        <br><br>
        "We are going to get through this together" - is your call.

    <p>With your clothes and only 5 of the items pulled from the wreckage (see list below), how will you survive?
