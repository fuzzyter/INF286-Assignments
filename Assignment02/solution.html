    <h1>Our Solution</h1>
    <h2>Desert Survival Strategy</h2>
    <p>After the devastating plane crash, our team and the other survivors were shaken up.
        We only had time to grab a few items we could only assume would be helpful in the long run,
        little did we know it would lead to our demise. The co-captain ran to try and grab a 6th
        but that's when the plane went up in flames. We watched in horror as the rest of our belongings burnt into ash.
        The heat of the sun was beating down on us and helped us realise the severity of our situation.
        We quickly had to make a decision, we must waste no time and press forward,
        it wouldn't be long before the sand would make claim to us. <br><br>

        Hours passed, we were too sweaty and exhausted to even talk to each other.
        That's when the other crew member who survived came up with the idea that we should dig a dune to hide
        behind to block the sun and rest. We decided we were gonna ration our water but then we saw some of it had
        evaporated in the heat. So now we have less water, oh great. But we weren't ready to lose hope yet.
        We drank enough to quench our thirst and waited for nightfall. <br><br>

        As the sun went down and the temperature began to cool, that's when we began our hike again.
        This cycle repeated until we were at our few last drops of water. People were getting agitated fast,
        we hadn't been able to keep up with any of the desert animals, nor get close enough to be able to kill
        something with only a pocket knife. Things were looking grim.<br><br>

        The next day, the heat started to get to Ryan. Everyone began to notice him talking and laughing to himself,
        staring off into the distance. Whispers spread among us. But it didn't take long for us all to start losing our
        minds.
        We all were hallucinating and going mad. Ryan mentioned to our group, excluding the co-captain and the crew
        member,
        telling us the "sun-god" said he would spare us if we made sacrifices. It wasn't hard to convince us, we were
        crazy!!
        That night when they went to sleep is when our plan went into action. Alice and Naeun began to draw a summoning
        circle.
        Stacy and Mayson tied the two unsuspecting victims up with our rope. Then Serenity and Ryan grabbed some rubbing
        alcohol from the first aid kit, and traced the outside of the circle. They threw the two into the circle and
        then
        Serenity striked a match, setting the circle on fire. The group danced and laughed around the circle,
        as the circle started to take the shape of the so-called sun god they spoke of. They danced all night until
        they were so exhausted their bodies gave out. Was that really the sun god they saw or were they just crazy?
        Mmm, probably just crazy. But it was a fun adventure with friends regardless!</p>
