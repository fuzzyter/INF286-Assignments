                    <b>Bootstrap</b> (formerly <b>Twitter Bootstrap</b>) is a free and
                    open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web
                    development. It contains HTML, CSS and (optionally) JavaScript-based design
                    templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface
                    components.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As of May 2023, Bootstrap is the 17th most starred project (4th most starred
                    library) on GitHub, with over 164,000 stars. According to W3Techs, Bootstrap
                    is used by 19.2% of all websites.
                </p>

                <h2 id="Features">Features</h2>

                <p>
                    Bootstrap is an HTML, CSS and JS library that focuses on simplifying the
                    development of informative web pages (as opposed to web applications). The
                    primary purpose of adding it to a web project is to apply Bootstrap's
                    choices of color, size, font and layout to that project. As such, the
                    primary factor is whether the developers in charge find those choices to
                    their liking. Once added to a project, Bootstrap provides basic style
                    definitions for all HTML elements. The result is a uniform appearance for
                    prose, tables and form elements across web browsers. In addition, developers
                    can take advantage of CSS classes defined in Bootstrap to further customize
                    the appearance of their contents. For example, Bootstrap has provisioned for
                    light- and dark-colored tables, page headings, more prominent pull quotes,
                    and text with a highlight.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Bootstrap also comes with several JavaScript components which do not require
                    other libraries like jQuery. They provide additional user interface elements
                    such as dialog boxes, tooltips, progress bars, navigation drop-downs, and
                    carousels. Each Bootstrap component consists of an HTML structure, CSS
                    declarations, and in some cases accompanying JavaScript code. They also
                    extend the functionality of some existing interface elements, including for
                    example an auto-complete function for input fields.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The most prominent components of Bootstrap are its layout components, as
                    they affect an entire web page. The basic layout component is called
                    "Container", as every other element in the page is placed in it. Developers
                    can choose between a fixed-width container and a fluid-width container.
                    While the latter always fills the width with the web page, the former uses
                    one of the five predefined fixed widths, depending on the size of the screen
                    showing the page:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Smaller than 576 pixels</li>
                    <li>576-768 pixels</li>
                    <li>768-992 pixels</li>
                    <li>992-1200 pixels</li>
                    <li>1200-1400 pixels</li>
                    <li>Larger than 1400 pixels</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Once a container is in place, other Bootstrap layout components implement a
                    CSS Flexbox layout through defining rows and columns.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A precompiled version of Bootstrap is available in the form of one CSS file
                    and three JavaScript files that can be readily added to any project. The raw
                    form of Bootstrap, however, enables developers to implement further
                    customization and size optimizations. This raw form is modular, meaning that
                    the developer can remove unneeded components, apply a theme and modify the
                    uncompiled Sass files.
                </p>

                <h3 id="Early_beginnings">Early beginnings</h3>

                <p>
                    Bootstrap, originally named Twitter Blueprint, was developed by Mark Otto
                    and Jacob Thornton at Twitter as a framework to encourage consistency across
                    internal tools. Before Bootstrap, various libraries were used for interface
                    development, which led to inconsistencies and a high maintenance burden.
                    According to Otto:
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        A super small group of developers and I got together to design and build
                        a new internal tool and saw an opportunity to do something more. Through
                        that process, we saw ourselves build something much more substantial
                        than another internal tool. Months later, we ended up with an early
                        version of Bootstrap as a way to document and share common design
                        patterns and assets within the company.
                    </p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                    After a few months of development by a small group, many developers at
                    Twitter began to contribute to the project as a part of Hack Week, a
                    hackathon-style week for the Twitter development team. It was renamed from
                    Twitter Blueprint to Twitter Bootstrap and released as an open-source
                    project on August 19, 2011. It has continued to be maintained by Otto,
                    Thornton, a small group of core developers, and a large community of
                    contributors.
                </p>

                <h3 id="Bootstrap_2">Bootstrap 2</h3>

                <p>
                    On January 31, 2012, Bootstrap 2 was released, which added built-in support
                    for Glyphicons, several new components, as well as changes to many of the
                    existing components. This version supports responsive web design, meaning
                    the layout of web pages adjusts dynamically, taking into account the
                    characteristics of the device used (whether desktop, tablet, mobile phone).
                    Shortly before the release of Bootstrap 2.1.2, Otto and Thornton left
                    Twitter, but committed to continue to work on Bootstrap as an independent
                    project.
                </p>

                <h3 id="Bootstrap_3">Bootstrap 3</h3>

                <p>
                    On August 19, 2013, Bootstrap 3 was released. It redesigned components to
                    use flat design and a mobile first approach. Bootstrap 3 features new plugin
                    system with namespaced events. Bootstrap 3 dropped Internet Explorer 7 and
                    Firefox 3.6 support, but there is an optional polyfill for these browsers.
                    Bootstrap 3 was also the first version released under the twbs organization
                    on GitHub instead of the Twitter one.
                </p>

                <h3 id="Bootstrap_4">Bootstrap 4</h3>

                <p>
                    Otto announced Bootstrap 4 on October 29, 2014. The first alpha version of
                    Bootstrap 4 was released on August 19, 2015. The first beta version was
                    released on August 10, 2017. Otto suspended work on Bootstrap 3 on September
                    6, 2016, to free up time to work on Bootstrap 4. Bootstrap 4 was finalized
                    on January 18, 2018.
