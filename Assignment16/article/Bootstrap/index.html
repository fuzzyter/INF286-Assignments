            Bootstrap (formerly Twitter Bootstrap) is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive,
            mobile-first
            front-end web development. It contains HTML, CSS and (optionally) JavaScript-based design templates for
            typography,
            forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.

            As of May 2023, Bootstrap is the 17th most starred project (4th most starred library) on GitHub, with over
            164,000
            stars. According to W3Techs, Bootstrap is used by 19.2% of all websites.

            Bootstrap is an HTML, CSS and JS library that focuses on simplifying the development of informative web
            pages (as
            opposed to web applications). The primary purpose of adding it to a web project is to apply Bootstrap's
            choices of
            color, size, font and layout to that project. As such, the primary factor is whether the developers in
            charge find those
            choices to their liking. Once added to a project, Bootstrap provides basic style definitions for all HTML
            elements. The
            result is a uniform appearance for prose, tables and form elements across web browsers. In addition,
            developers can take
            advantage of CSS classes defined in Bootstrap to further customize the appearance of their contents. For
            example,
            Bootstrap has provisioned for light- and dark-colored tables, page headings, more prominent pull quotes, and
            text with a
            highlight.

            Bootstrap also comes with several JavaScript components which do not require other libraries like jQuery.
            They provide
            additional user interface elements such as dialog boxes, tooltips, progress bars, navigation drop-downs, and
            carousels.
            Each Bootstrap component consists of an HTML structure, CSS declarations, and in some cases accompanying
            JavaScript
            code. They also extend the functionality of some existing interface elements, including for example an
            auto-complete
            function for input fields.
