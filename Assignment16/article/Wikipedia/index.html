                    <b>Wikipedia</b> is a free online encyclopedia written and maintained by a
                    community of volunteers, known as Wikipedians, through open collaboration
                    and the wiki software MediaWiki. Founded by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger in
                    2001, Wikipedia has been hosted since 2003 by the Wikimedia Foundation, an
                    American nonprofit organization funded mainly by donations from readers.
                    Wikipedia is the largest and most-read reference work in history.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Initially available only in English, Wikipedia exists in over 340 languages
                    and is the world's ninth most visited website. The English Wikipedia, with
                    over 7 million articles, remains the largest of the editions, which together
                    comprise more than 66 million articles and attract more than 1.5 billion
                    unique device visits and 13 million edits per month (about 5 edits per
                    second on average) as of April 2024. As of September 2025, over 25% of
                    Wikipedia's traffic comes from the United States, while Japan accounts for
                    nearly 7%, and the United Kingdom, Germany and Russia each represent around
                    5%.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Wikipedia has been praised for enabling the democratization of knowledge,
                    its extensive coverage, unique structure, and culture. Wikipedia has been
                    censored by some national governments, ranging from specific pages to the
                    entire site. Wikipedia's volunteer editors have written extensively on a
                    wide variety of topics, but the encyclopedia has also been criticized for
                    systemic bias, such as a gender bias against women and a geographical bias
                    against the Global South. While the reliability of Wikipedia was frequently
                    criticized in the 2000s, it has improved over time, receiving greater praise
                    from the late 2010s onward. Articles on breaking news are often accessed as
                    sources for up-to-date information about those events.

                    Various collaborative online encyclopedias were attempted before the start
                    of Wikipedia, but with limited success. Wikipedia began as a complementary
                    project for Nupedia, a free online English-language encyclopedia project
                    whose articles were written by experts and reviewed under a formal process.
                    It was founded on March 9, 2000, under the ownership of Bomis, a web portal
                    company. Its main figures were Bomis CEO Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger,
                    editor-in-chief for Nupedia and later Wikipedia. Nupedia was initially
                    licensed under its own Nupedia Open Content License, but before Wikipedia
                    was founded, Nupedia switched to the GNU Free Documentation License at the
                    urging of Richard Stallman. Wales is credited with defining the goal of
                    making a publicly editable encyclopedia, while Sanger is credited with the
                    strategy of using a wiki to reach that goal. On January 10, 2001, Sanger
                    proposed on the Nupedia mailing list to create a wiki as a "feeder" project
                    for Nupedia.

                <p>
                    Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001 (referred to as
                    <i>Wikipedia Day</i>) as a single English language edition with the domain
                    name <i>www.wikipedia.com</i>, and was announced by Sanger on the Nupedia
                    mailing list. The name, proposed by Sanger to forestall any potential damage
                    to the Nupedia name, originated from a blend of the words <i>wiki</i> and
                    <i>encyclopedia</i>. Its integral policy of "neutral point of view" arose
                    within its first year. Otherwise, there were initially relatively few rules,
                    and it operated independently of Nupedia. Bomis originally intended for it
                    to be a for-profit business.

                    Wikipedia gained early contributors from Nupedia,
                    <i>Slashdot</i> postings, and web search engine indexing. Language editions
                    were created beginning in March 2001, with a total of 161 in use by the end
                    of 2004. Nupedia and Wikipedia coexisted until the former's servers were
                    taken down permanently in 2003, and its text was incorporated into
                    Wikipedia. The English Wikipedia passed the mark of 2 million articles on
                    September 9, 2007, making it the largest encyclopedia ever assembled,
                    surpassing the <i>Yongle Encyclopedia</i> made in China during the Ming
                    dynasty in 1408, which had held the record for almost 600 years.

                    Citing fears of commercial advertising and lack of control, users of the
                    Spanish Wikipedia forked from Wikipedia to create Enciclopedia Libre in
                    February 2002. Wales then announced that Wikipedia would not display
                    advertisements, and changed Wikipedia's domain from
                    <i>wikipedia.com</i> to <i>wikipedia.org</i>.

                    After an early period of exponential growth, the growth rate of the English
                    Wikipedia in terms of the numbers of new articles and of editors, appears to
                    have peaked around early 2007. The edition reached 3 million articles in
                    August 2009. Around 1,800 articles were added daily to the encyclopedia in
                    2006; by 2013 that average was roughly 800. A team at the Palo Alto Research
                    Center attributed this slowing of growth to "increased coordination and
                    overhead costs, exclusion of newcomers, and resistance to new edits". Others
                    suggested that the growth flattened naturally because articles that could be
                    called "low-hanging fruit"—topics that clearly merit an article—had already
                    been created and built up extensively.

                    In November 2009, a researcher at the Rey Juan Carlos University in Madrid,
                    Spain, found that the English Wikipedia had lost 49,000 editors during the
                    first three months of 2009; in comparison, it lost only 4,900 editors during
                    the same period in 2008.
                    <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> cited the array of rules applied to editing
                    and disputes related to such content among the reasons for this trend. Wales
                    disputed these claims in 2009, denying the decline and questioning the
                    study's methodology. Two years later, in 2011, he acknowledged a slight
                    decline, noting a decrease from "a little more than 36,000 writers" in June
                    2010 to 35,800 in June 2011. In the same interview, he also claimed the
                    number of editors was "stable and sustainable". A 2013
                    <i>MIT Technology Review</i> article, "The Decline of Wikipedia", questioned
                    this claim, reporting that since 2007 Wikipedia had lost a third of its
                    volunteer editors, and suggesting that those remaining had focused
                    increasingly on minutiae. In July 2012, <i>The Atlantic</i> reported that
                    the number of administrators was also in decline. In November 2013,
                    <i>New York</i> magazine stated, "Wikipedia, the sixth-most-used website, is
                    facing an internal crisis." The number of active English Wikipedia editors
                    has since remained steady after a long period of decline.

                    Wikipedia has spawned several sister projects, which are also wikis run by
                    the Wikimedia Foundation. These other Wikimedia projects include Wiktionary,
                    a dictionary project launched in December 2002, Wikiquote, a collection of
                    quotations created a week after Wikimedia launched, Wikibooks, a collection
                    of collaboratively written free textbooks and annotated texts, Wikimedia
                    Commons, a site devoted to free-knowledge multimedia, Wikinews, for
                    collaborative journalism, and Wikiversity, a project for the creation of
                    free learning materials and the provision of online learning activities.
                    Another sister project of Wikipedia, Wikispecies, is a catalog of all
                    species, but is not open for public editing. In 2012, Wikivoyage, an
                    editable travel guide, and Wikidata, an editable knowledge base, launched.

                    In January 2007, Wikipedia first became one of the ten most popular websites
                    in the United States, according to Comscore Networks. With 42.9 million
                    unique visitors, it was ranked ninth, surpassing
                    <i>The New York Times</i> (No. 10) and Apple (No. 11). This marked a
                    significant increase over January 2006, when Wikipedia ranked 33rd, with
                    around 18.3 million unique visitors. In 2014, it received 8 billion page
                    views every month. On February 9, 2014, <i>The New York Times</i> reported
                    that Wikipedia had 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique
                    visitors a month, "according to the ratings firm comScore". As of March
                    2023, it ranked sixth in popularity, according to Similarweb. Jeff Loveland
                    and Joseph Reagle argue that, in process, Wikipedia follows a long tradition
                    of historical encyclopedias that have accumulated improvements piecemeal
                    through "stigmergic accumulation".

                    On January 18, 2012, the English Wikipedia participated in a series of
                    coordinated protests against two proposed laws in the United States
                    Congress—the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the PROTECT IP Act (PIPA)—by
                    blacking out its pages for 24 hours. More than 162 million people viewed the
                    blackout explanation page that temporarily replaced its content.

                    In January 2013, 274301 Wikipedia, an asteroid, was named after Wikipedia;
                    in October 2014, Wikipedia was honored with the
                    <i>Wikipedia Monument</i>; and, in July 2015, 106 of the 7,473 700-page

                    Israeli lunar lander, Beresheet, crash landed on the surface of the Moon
                    carrying a copy of nearly all of the English Wikipedia engraved on thin
                    nickel plates; experts say the plates likely survived the crash. In June
                    2019, scientists reported that all 16 GB of article text from the English
                    Wikipedia had been encoded into synthetic DNA.

                    On January 20, 2014, Subodh Varma reporting for
                    <i>The Economic Times</i> indicated that not only had Wikipedia's growth
                    stalled, it "had lost nearly ten percent of its page views last year. There
                    was a decline of about 2 billion between December 2012 and December 2013.
                    Its most popular versions are leading the slide: page-views of the English
                    Wikipedia declined by twelve percent, those of German version slid by 17
                    percent and the Japanese version lost 9 percent." Varma added, "While
                    Wikipedia's managers think that this could be due to errors in counting,
                    other experts feel that Google's Knowledge Graphs project launched last year
                    may be gobbling up Wikipedia users." When contacted on this matter, Clay
                    Shirky, associate professor at New York University and fellow at Harvard's
                    Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society said that he suspected much
                    of the page-view decline was due to Knowledge Graphs, stating, "If you can
                    get your question answered from the search page, you don't need to click
                    [any further]." By the end of December 2016, Wikipedia was ranked the fifth
                    most popular website globally. As of January 2023, 55,791 English Wikipedia
                    articles have been cited 92,300 times in scholarly journals, from which
                    cloud computing was the most cited page.

                    On January 18, 2023, Wikipedia debuted a new website redesign, called
                    "Vector 2022". It featured a redesigned menu bar, moving the table of
                    contents to the left as a sidebar, and numerous changes in the locations of
                    buttons like the language selection tool. The update initially received
                    backlash, most notably when editors of the Swahili Wikipedia unanimously
                    voted to revert the changes.

                    Since January 2024, the Wikimedia Foundation has reported a roughly 50
                    percent increase in bandwidth use from downloads of multimedia content
                    across its projects. According to the foundation, this growth is largely
                    attributed to automated programs, or "scraper" bots, that collect large
                    volumes of data from Wikimedia sites for use in training large language
                    models and related applications.

                    views. They speculate it reflects the use of generative AI and social media

                <p>
                    Due to Wikipedia's increasing popularity, some editions, including the
                    English version, have introduced editing restrictions for certain cases. For
                    instance, on the English Wikipedia and some other language editions, only
                    registered users may create a new article. On the English Wikipedia, among
                    others, particularly controversial, sensitive, or vandalism-prone pages have
                    been protected to varying degrees. A frequently vandalized article can be
                    "semi-protected" or "extended confirmed protected", meaning that only
                    "autoconfirmed" or "extended confirmed" editors can modify it. A
                    particularly contentious article may be locked so that only administrators
                    can make changes. A 2021 article in the
                    <i>Columbia Journalism Review</i> identified Wikipedia's page-protection
                    policies as "perhaps the most important" means at its disposal to "regulate
                    its market of ideas". Wikipedia has delegated some functions to bots. Such
                    algorithmic governance has an ease of implementation and scaling, though the
                    automated rejection of edits may have contributed to a downturn in active
                    Wikipedia editors. Bots must be approved by the community before their tasks
                    are implemented.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In certain cases, all editors are allowed to submit modifications, but
                    review is required for some editors, depending on certain conditions. For
                    example, the German Wikipedia maintains "stable versions" of articles which
                    have passed certain reviews. Following protracted trials and community
                    discussion, the English Wikipedia introduced the "pending changes" system in
                    December 2012. Under this system, new and unregistered users' edits to
                    certain controversial or vandalism-prone articles are reviewed by
                    established users before they are published. However, restrictions on
                    editing may reduce the editor engagement as well as efforts to diversify the
                    editing community.

                    Articles related to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict are placed under
                    extended-confirmed protection. Editors also can make only one revert per day
                    across the entire field and can be banned from editing related articles.
                    These restrictions were introduced in 2008. In January 2025, the Arbitration
                    Committee introduced the "balanced editing restriction", which requires
                    sanctioned users to devote only a third of their edits to articles related
                    to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict even when no misconduct rules have been
                    violated.

                <p>
                    Although changes are not systematically reviewed, Wikipedia's software
                    provides tools allowing anyone to review changes made by others. Each
                    article's History page links to each revision. On most articles, anyone can
                    view the latest changes and undo others' revisions by clicking a link on the
                    article's History page. Registered users may maintain a "watchlist" of
                    articles that interest them so they can be notified of changes. "New pages
                    patrol" is a process where newly created articles are checked for obvious
                    problems.

                    In 2003, economics PhD student Andrea Ciffolilli argued that the low
                    transaction costs of participating in a wiki created a catalyst for
                    collaborative development, and that features such as allowing easy access to
                    past versions of a page favored "creative construction" over "creative
                    destruction".

                <p>
                    Any change that deliberately compromises Wikipedia's integrity is considered
                    vandalism. The most common and obvious types of vandalism include additions
                    of obscenities and crude humor; it can also include advertising and other
                    types of spam. Sometimes editors commit vandalism by removing content or
                    entirely blanking a given page. Less common types of vandalism, such as the
                    deliberate addition of plausible but false information, can be more
                    difficult to detect. Vandals can introduce irrelevant formatting, modify
                    page semantics such as the page's title or categorization, manipulate the
                    article's underlying code, or use images disruptively.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Obvious vandalism is generally easy to remove from Wikipedia articles; the
                    median time to detect and fix it is a few minutes. However, some vandalism
                    takes much longer to detect and repair.

                    In the Seigenthaler biography incident, an anonymous editor introduced false
                    information into the biography of American political figure John
                    Seigenthaler in May 2005, falsely presenting him as a suspect in the
                    assassination of John F. Kennedy. It remained uncorrected for four months.
                    Seigenthaler, the founding editorial director of <i>USA Today</i> and
                    founder of the Freedom Forum First Amendment Center at Vanderbilt
                    University, called Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales and asked whether he had
                    any way of knowing who contributed the misinformation. Wales said he did
                    not, although the perpetrator was eventually traced. After the incident,
                    Seigenthaler described Wikipedia as "a flawed and irresponsible research
                    tool". The incident led to policy changes at Wikipedia for tightening up the
                    verifiability of biographical articles of living people.

                <p>
                    Wikipedia editors often have disagreements regarding content, which can be
                    discussed on article Talk pages. Disputes may result in repeated competing
                    changes to an article, known as "edit warring". It is widely seen as a
                    resource-consuming scenario where no useful knowledge is added, and
                    criticized as creating a competitive and conflict-based editing culture
                    associated with traditional masculine gender roles. Research has focused on,
                    for example, impoliteness of disputes, the influence of rival editing camps,
                    the conversational structure, and the shift in conflicts to a focus on
                    sources.

                    Taha Yasseri of the University of Oxford examined editing conflicts and
                    their resolution in a 2013 study. Yasseri contended that simple reverts or
                    "undo" operations were not the most significant measure of counterproductive
                    work behavior at Wikipedia. He relied instead on "mutually reverting edit
                    pairs", where one editor reverts the edit of another editor who then, in
                    sequence, returns to revert the first editor. The results were tabulated for
                    several language versions of Wikipedia. The English Wikipedia's three
                    largest conflict rates belonged to the articles George W. Bush, anarchism,
                    and Muhammad. By comparison, for the German Wikipedia, the three largest
                    conflict rates at the time of the study were for the articles covering
                    Croatia, Scientology, and 9/11 conspiracy theories. In 2020, researchers
                    identified other measures of editor behaviors, beyond mutual reverts, to
                    identify editing conflicts across Wikipedia.

                    Editors also debate the deletion of articles on Wikipedia, with roughly
                    500,000 such debates since Wikipedia's inception. Once an article is
                    nominated for deletion, the dispute is typically determined by initial votes
                    (to keep or delete) and by reference to topic-specific notability policies.

                    Wikipedia is composed of 11 different namespaces, with its articles being
                    present in <i>mainspace</i>. Other namespaces have a prefix before their
                    page title and fulfill various purposes. For example, the project namespace
                    uses the <i>Wikipedia</i> prefix and is used for self-governance related
                    discussions. Most readers are not aware of these other namespaces.

                    The fundamental principles of the Wikipedia community are embodied in the
                    "Five pillars", while the detailed editorial principles are expressed in
                    numerous policies and guidelines intended to appropriately shape content.
                    The five pillars are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wikipedia is an encyclopedia</li>
                    <li>Wikipedia is written from a neutral point of view</li>
                    <li>Wikipedia is free content that anyone can use, edit, and distribute</li>
                    <li>
                        Wikipedia's editors should treat each other with respect and civility
                    </li>
                    <li>Wikipedia has no firm rules</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The rules developed by the community are stored in wiki form, and Wikipedia
                    editors write and revise the website's policies and guidelines in accordance
                    with community consensus. Originally, rules on the non-English editions of
                    Wikipedia were based on a translation of the rules for the English
                    Wikipedia. They have since diverged to some extent.

                </p>

                <p>
                    According to the rules on the English Wikipedia community, each entry in
                    Wikipedia must be about a topic that is encyclopedic and is not a dictionary
                    entry or dictionary-style. A topic should also meet Wikipedia's standards of
                    "notability", which generally means that the topic has been covered
                    extensively in reliable sources that are independent of the article's
                    subject. Wikipedia intends to convey only knowledge that is already
                    established and recognized and therefore must not present original research.
                    Some subjects such as politicians and academics have specialized notability
                    requirements. Finally, Wikipedia must reflect a neutral point of view. This
                    is accomplished through summarizing reliable sources, using impartial
                    language, and ensuring that multiple points of view are presented based on
                    their prominence. Information must also be verifiable. Information without
                    citations may be tagged or removed entirely. This can at times lead to the
                    removal of information which, though valid, is not properly sourced. As
                    Wikipedia policies changed over time, and became more complex, their number
                    has grown. In 2008, there were 44 policy pages and 248 guideline pages; by
                    2013, scholars counted 383 policy pages and 449 guideline pages.

                    Wikipedia's initial anarchy integrated democratic and hierarchical elements
                    over time. An article is not considered to be owned by its creator or any
                    other editor, nor by the subject of the article. Editors in good standing in
                    the community can request extra user rights, granting them the technical
                    ability to perform certain special actions. Some user rights are granted
                    automatically, such as the <i>autoconfirmed</i> and
                    <i>extended confirmed</i> groups, when thresholds for account age and edits
                    are met.

                <p>
                    Experienced editors can choose to run for "adminship", which includes the
                    ability to delete pages or prevent them from being changed in cases of
                    severe vandalism or editorial disputes. Administrators are not supposed to
                    enjoy any special privilege in decision-making; instead, their powers are
                    mostly limited to making edits that have project-wide effects and thus are
                    disallowed to ordinary editors, and to implement restrictions intended to
                    prevent disruptive editors from making unproductive edits.
                </p>

                <p>
                    By 2012, fewer editors were becoming administrators compared to Wikipedia's
                    earlier years, in part because the process of vetting potential
                    administrators had become more rigorous. In 2022, there was a particularly
                    contentious request for adminship over the candidate's anti-Trump views;
                    ultimately, they were granted adminship.

                <h3 id="Dispute_resolution">Dispute resolution</h3>
                <p>
                    Over time, Wikipedia has developed a semi-formal dispute resolution process.
                    To determine community consensus, editors can raise issues at appropriate
                    community forums, seek outside input through third opinion requests, or
                    initiate a more general community discussion known as a "request for
                    comment", in which bots add the discussion to a centralized list of
                    discussions, invite editors to participate, and remove the discussion from
                    the list after 30 days. However, editors have the discretion to close (and
                    delist) the discussion early or late. If the result of a discussion is not
                    obvious, a closer—an uninvolved editor usually in good standing—may render a
                    verdict from the strength of the arguments presented and then the numbers of
                    arguers on each side. Wikipedians emphasize that the process is not a vote
                    by referring to statements of opinion in such discussions as "!vote"s, in
                    which the exclamation mark is the symbol for logical negation and pronounced
                    "not".
                </p>

                <p>
                    Wikipedia encourages local resolutions of conflicts, which Jemielniak argues
                    is quite unique in organization studies, though there has been some recent
                    interest in consensus building in the field. Reagle and Sue Gardner argue
                    that the approaches to consensus building are similar to those used by
                    Quakers. A difference from Quaker meetings is the absence of a facilitator
                    in the presence of disagreement, a role played by the clerk in Quaker
                    meetings.

                <p>
                    The Arbitration Committee presides over the ultimate dispute resolution
                    process. Although disputes usually arise from a disagreement between two
                    opposing views on how an article should read, the Arbitration Committee
                    explicitly refuses to directly rule on the specific view that should be
                    adopted.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Statistical analyses suggest that the English Wikipedia committee ignores
                    the content of disputes and rather focuses on the way disputes are
                    conducted, functioning not so much to resolve disputes and make peace
                    between conflicting editors, but to weed out problematic editors while
                    allowing potentially productive editors back in to participate. Therefore,
                    the committee does not dictate the content of articles, although it
                    sometimes condemns content changes when it deems the new content violates
                    Wikipedia policies (for example, if the new content is considered biased).
                    Commonly used solutions include cautions and probations (used in 63% of
                    cases) and banning editors from articles (43%), subject matters (23%), or
                    Wikipedia (16%). Complete bans from Wikipedia are generally limited to
                    instances of impersonation and antisocial behavior. When conduct is not
                    impersonation or anti-social, but rather edit warring and other violations
                    of editing policies, solutions tend to be limited to warnings.

                <p>
                    Each article and each user of Wikipedia has an associated and dedicated
                    "talk" page. These form the primary communication channel for editors to
                    discuss, coordinate and debate. Wikipedia's community has been described as
                    cultlike, although not always with entirely negative connotations. Its
                    preference for cohesiveness, even if it requires compromise that includes
                    disregard of credentials, has been referred to as "anti-elitism".
                </p>

                <p>
                    Wikipedia does not require that its editors and contributors provide
                    identification. As Wikipedia grew, "Who writes Wikipedia?" became one of the
                    questions frequently asked there. Jimmy Wales once argued that only "a
                    community ... a dedicated group of a few hundred volunteers" makes the bulk
                    of contributions to Wikipedia and that the project is therefore "much like
                    any traditional organization". Since Wikipedia relies on volunteer labour,
                    editors frequently focus on topics that interest them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The English Wikipedia has 7,100,723 articles, 50,459,627 registered editors,
                    and 314,074 active editors. An editor is considered active if they have made
                    one or more edits in the past 30 days. Editors who fail to comply with
                    Wikipedia cultural rituals, such as signing talk page comments, may
                    implicitly signal that they are Wikipedia outsiders, increasing the odds
                    that Wikipedia insiders may target or discount their contributions. Becoming
                    a Wikipedia insider involves non-trivial costs: the contributor is expected
                    to learn Wikipedia-specific technological codes, submit to a sometimes
                    convoluted dispute resolution process, and learn a "baffling culture rich
                    with in-jokes and insider references". Editors who do not log in are in some
                    sense "second-class citizens" on Wikipedia, as "participants are accredited
                    by members of the wiki community, who have a vested interest in preserving
                    the quality of the work product, on the basis of their ongoing
                    participation", but the contribution histories of anonymous unregistered
                    editors recognized only by their IP addresses cannot be attributed to a
                    particular editor with certainty. New editors often struggle to understand
                    Wikipedia's complexity. Experienced editors are encouraged to not "bite" the
                    newcomers in order to create a more welcoming atmosphere.

                <p>
                    A 2007 study by researchers from Dartmouth College found that "anonymous and
                    infrequent contributors to Wikipedia ... are as reliable a source of
                    knowledge as those contributors who register with the site". Jimmy Wales
                    stated in 2009 that "[I]t turns out over 50% of all the edits are done by
                    just 0.7% of the users ... 524 people ... And in fact, the most active 2%,
                    which is 1400 people, have done 73.4% of all the edits." However,
                    <i>Business Insider</i> editor and journalist Henry Blodget showed in 2009
                    that in a random sample of articles, most Wikipedia content (measured by the
                    amount of contributed text that survives to the latest sampled edit) is
                    created by "outsiders", while most editing and formatting is done by
                    "insiders".
                </p>

                <p>
                    In 2008, a <i>Slate</i> magazine article reported that "one percent of
                    Wikipedia users are responsible for about half of the site's edits." This
                    method of evaluating contributions was later disputed by Aaron Swartz, who
                    noted that several articles he sampled had large portions of their content
                    (measured by number of characters) contributed by users with low edit
                    counts. A 2008 study found that Wikipedians were less agreeable, open, and
                    conscientious than others, although a later commentary pointed out serious
                    flaws, including that the data showed higher openness and that the
                    differences with the control group and the samples were small. According to
                    a 2009 study, there is "evidence of growing resistance from the Wikipedia
                    community to new content".

                <h3 id="Diversity">Diversity</h3>

                <p>
                    Several studies have shown that most volunteer Wikipedia contributors are
                    male. Notably, the results of a Wikimedia Foundation survey in 2008 showed
                    that only 13 percent of Wikipedia editors were female. Because of this,
                    universities throughout the United States tried to encourage women to become
                    Wikipedia contributors. Similarly, many of these universities, including
                    Yale and Brown, gave college credit to students who create or edit an
                    article relating to women in science or technology. Andrew Lih, a professor
                    and scientist, said that the reason he thought the number of male
                    contributors outnumbered the number of females so greatly was because
                    identifying as a woman may expose oneself to "ugly, intimidating behavior".
                    Data has shown that Africans are underrepresented among Wikipedia editors.

                    Wikipedias owe their position to the article-creating bot Lsjbot, which as
                    of 2013 had created about half the articles on the Swedish Wikipedia, and
                    most of the articles in the Cebuano and Waray Wikipedias. The latter are

                    10,000. The largest, the English Wikipedia, has over 7.1 million articles.
                    As of January 2021, the English Wikipedia receives 48% of Wikipedia's
                    cumulative traffic, with the remaining split among the other languages. The
                    top 10 editions represent approximately 85% of the total traffic.

                    Since Wikipedia is based on the Web and therefore worldwide, contributors to
                    the same language edition may use different dialects or may come from
                    different countries (as is the case for the English edition). These
                    differences may lead to some conflicts over spelling differences (e.g.
                    <i>colour</i> versus <i>color</i>) or points of view.

                    Though the various language editions are held to global policies such as
                    "neutral point of view", they diverge on some points of policy and practice,
                    most notably on whether images that are not licensed freely may be used
                    under a claim of fair use. The content of articles on the same subject can
                    differ significantly between languages, depending on the sources editors use
                    and other factors.

                    Jimmy Wales has described Wikipedia as "an effort to create and distribute a
                    free encyclopedia of the highest possible quality to every single person on
                    the planet in their own language". Though each language edition functions
                    more or less independently, some efforts are made to supervise them all.
                    They are coordinated in part by Meta-Wiki, the Wikimedia Foundation's wiki
                    devoted to maintaining all its projects (Wikipedia and others). For
                    instance, Meta-Wiki provides important statistics on all language editions
                    of Wikipedia, and it maintains a list of articles every Wikipedia should
                    have. The list concerns basic content by subject: biography, history,
                    geography, society, culture, science, technology, and mathematics. It is not
                    rare for articles strongly related to a particular language not to have
                    counterparts in another edition. For example, articles about small towns in
                    the United States might be available only in English, even when they meet
                    the notability criteria of other language Wikipedia projects.

                    Translated articles represent only a small portion of articles in most
                    editions, in part because those editions do not allow fully automated
                    translation of articles. Articles available in more than one language may
                    offer "interwiki links", which link to the counterpart articles in other
                    editions.

                    A study published by <i>PLOS One</i> in 2012 also estimated the share of
                    contributions to different editions of Wikipedia from different regions of
                    the world. It reported that the proportion of the edits made from North
                    America was 51% for the English Wikipedia, and 25% for the Simple English
                    Wikipedia.

                    On March 1, 2014, <i>The Economist</i>, in an article titled "The Future of
                    Wikipedia", cited a trend analysis concerning data published by the
                    Wikimedia Foundation stating that "the number of editors for the
                    English-language version has fallen by a third in seven years." The
                    attrition rate for active editors in English Wikipedia was cited by
                    <i>The Economist</i> as substantially in contrast to statistics for
                    Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia).
                    <i>The Economist</i> reported that the number of contributors with an
                    average of five or more edits per month was relatively constant since 2008
                    for Wikipedia in other languages at approximately 42,000 editors within
                    narrow seasonal variances of about 2,000 editors up or down. The number of
                    active editors in English Wikipedia, by sharp comparison, was cited as
                    peaking in 2007 at approximately 50,000 and dropping to 30,000 by the start
                    of 2014.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In contrast, the trend analysis for Wikipedia in other languages
                    (non-English Wikipedia) shows success in retaining active editors on a
                    renewable and sustained basis, with their numbers remaining relatively
                    constant at approximately 42,000. No comment was made concerning which of
                    the differentiated edit policy standards from Wikipedia in other languages
                    (non-English Wikipedia) would provide a possible alternative to English
                    Wikipedia for effectively improving substantial editor attrition rates on
                    the English-language Wikipedia.

                    Various Wikipedians have criticized Wikipedia's large and growing
                    regulation, which includes more than fifty policies and nearly 150,000 words
                    as of 2014. Critics have stated that Wikipedia exhibits systemic bias. In
                    2010, columnist and journalist Edwin Black described Wikipedia as being a
                    mixture of "truth, half-truth, and some falsehoods". Articles in
                    <i>The Chronicle of Higher Education</i> and
                    <i>The Journal of Academic Librarianship</i> have criticized Wikipedia's
                    "undue-weight policy", concluding that Wikipedia explicitly is not designed
                    to provide correct information about a subject, but rather focus on all the
                    major viewpoints on the subject, give less attention to minor ones, and
                    creates omissions that can lead to false beliefs based on incomplete
                    information.

                <p>
                    Journalists Oliver Kamm and Edwin Black alleged (in 2010 and 2011
                    respectively) that articles are dominated by the loudest and most persistent
                    voices, usually by a group with an "ax to grind" on the topic. A 2008
                    article in <i>Education Next</i> journal concluded that as a resource about
                    controversial topics, Wikipedia is subject to manipulation and spin. In
                    2020, Omer Benjakob and Stephen Harrison noted that "Media coverage of
                    Wikipedia has radically shifted over the past two decades: once cast as an
                    intellectual frivolity, it is now lauded as the 'last bastion of shared
                    reality' online."

                <p>
                    Multiple news networks and pundits have accused Wikipedia of being
                    ideologically biased. In February 2021, Fox News accused Wikipedia of
                    whitewashing communism and socialism and having too much "leftist bias".
                    Wikipedia co-founder Sanger said that Wikipedia has become a "propaganda"
                    for the left-leaning "establishment" and warned the site can no longer be
                    trusted. In 2022, libertarian John Stossel opined that Wikipedia, a site he
                    financially supported at one time, appeared to have gradually taken a
                    significant turn in bias to the political left, specifically on political
                    topics. Some studies suggest that Wikipedia (and in particular the English
                    Wikipedia) has a "western cultural bias" (or "pro-western bias") or
                    "Eurocentric bias", reiterating, says Anna Samoilenko, "similar biases that
                    are found in the 'ivory tower' of academic historiography". Carwil
                    Bjork-James proposes that Wikipedia could follow the diversification pattern
                    of contemporary scholarship and Dangzhi Zhao calls for a "decolonization" of
                    Wikipedia to reduce bias from opinionated White male editors.

                    Articles for traditional encyclopedias such as
                    <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i> are written by experts, lending such
                    encyclopedias a reputation for accuracy. However, a peer review in 2005 of
                    forty-two scientific entries on both Wikipedia and
                    <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i> by the science journal <i>Nature</i> found
                    few differences in accuracy, and concluded that "the average science entry
                    in Wikipedia contained around four inaccuracies; <i>Britannica</i>, about
                    three." Joseph Reagle suggested that while the study reflects "a topical
                    strength of Wikipedia contributors" in science articles, "Wikipedia may not
                    have fared so well using a random sampling of articles or on humanities
                    subjects."
                </p>

                <p>
                    Others raised similar critiques. The findings by <i>Nature</i> were disputed
                    by <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i>, and in response, <i>Nature</i> gave a
                    rebuttal of the points raised by <i>Britannica</i>. In addition to the
                    point-for-point disagreement between these two parties, others have examined
                    the sample size and selection method used in the <i>Nature</i> effort, and
                    suggested a "flawed study design" (in <i>Nature</i>'s manual selection of
                    articles, in part or in whole, for comparison), absence of statistical
                    analysis (e.g., of reported confidence intervals), and a lack of study
                    "statistical power" (i.e., owing to small sample size, 42 or 4 × 10<sup>1</sup>
                    articles compared, vs &gt;10<sup>5</sup> and &gt;10<sup>6</sup> set sizes
                    for
                    <i>Britannica</i>
                    and the English Wikipedia, respectively).

                <p>
                    As a consequence of the open structure, Wikipedia "makes no guarantee of
                    validity" of its content, since no one is ultimately responsible for any
                    claims appearing in it. Concerns have been raised by <i>PC World</i> in 2009
                    regarding the lack of accountability that results from users' anonymity, the
                    insertion of false information, vandalism, and similar problems.
                    <i>Legal Research in a Nutshell</i> (2011), cites Wikipedia as a "general
                    source" that "can be a real boon" in "coming up to speed in the law
                    governing a situation" and, "while not authoritative, can provide basic
                    facts as well as leads to more in-depth resources".

                    Economist Tyler Cowen wrote: "If I had to guess whether Wikipedia or the
                    median refereed journal article on economics was more likely to be true
                    after a not so long think I would opt for Wikipedia." He comments that some
                    traditional sources of non-fiction suffer from systemic biases, and novel
                    results, in his opinion, are over-reported in journal articles as well as
                    relevant information being omitted from news reports. However, he also
                    cautions that errors are frequently found on Internet sites and that
                    academics and experts must be vigilant in correcting them. Amy Bruckman has
                    argued that, due to the number of reviewers, "the content of a popular
                    Wikipedia page is actually the most reliable form of information ever
                    created". In September 2022,
                    <i>The Sydney Morning Herald</i> journalist Liam Mannix noted that: "There's
                    no reason to expect Wikipedia to be accurate ... And yet it [is]." Mannix
                    further discussed the multiple studies that have proved Wikipedia to be
                    generally as reliable as <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i>, summarizing that
                    "...turning our back on such an extraordinary resource is... well, a little
                    petty."

                <p>
                    Critics argue that Wikipedia's open nature and a lack of proper sources for
                    most of the information makes it unreliable. Some commentators suggest that
                    Wikipedia may be reliable, but that the reliability of any given article is
                    not clear. Editors of traditional reference works such as the
                    <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i> have questioned the project's utility and
                    status as an encyclopedia. Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales has claimed that
                    Wikipedia has largely avoided the problem of "fake news" because the
                    Wikipedia community regularly debates the quality of sources in articles.

                <p>
                    Wikipedia's open structure inherently makes it an easy target for Internet
                    trolls, spammers, and various forms of paid advocacy seen as
                    counterproductive to the maintenance of a neutral and verifiable online
                    encyclopedia. In response to paid advocacy editing and undisclosed editing
                    issues, Wikipedia was reported in an article in
                    <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> to have strengthened its rules and laws
                    against undisclosed editing. The article stated that: "Beginning Monday
                    [from the date of the article, June 16, 2014], changes in Wikipedia's terms
                    of use will require anyone paid to edit articles to disclose that
                    arrangement. Katherine Maher, the nonprofit Wikimedia Foundation's chief
                    communications officer, said the changes address a sentiment among volunteer
                    editors that 'we're not an advertising service; we're an encyclopedia.'"
                    These issues, among others, had been parodied since the first decade of
                    Wikipedia, notably by Stephen Colbert on <i>The Colbert Report</i>.

                    Some university lecturers discourage students from citing any encyclopedia
                    in academic work, preferring primary sources; some specifically prohibit
                    Wikipedia citations. Wales stresses that encyclopedias of any type are not
                    usually appropriate to use as citable sources, and should not be relied upon
                    as authoritative. Wales once (2006 or earlier) said he receives about ten
                    emails weekly from students saying they got failing grades on papers because
                    they cited Wikipedia; he told the students they got what they deserved. "For
                    God's sake, you're in college; don't cite the encyclopedia", he said.

                    Wikipedia articles in their syllabi, although without realizing the articles
                    might change. In June 2007, Michael Gorman, former president of the American
                    Library Association, condemned Wikipedia, along with Google, stating that
                    academics who endorse the use of Wikipedia are "the intellectual equivalent
                    of a dietitian who recommends a steady diet of Big Macs with everything".

                    A 2020 research study published in
                    <i>Studies in Higher Education</i> argued that Wikipedia could be applied in
                    the higher education "flipped classroom", an educational model where
                    students learn before coming to class and apply it in classroom activities.
                    The experimental group was instructed to learn before class and get
                    immediate feedback before going in (the flipped classroom model), while the
                    control group was given direct instructions in class (the conventional
                    classroom model). The groups were then instructed to collaboratively develop
                    Wikipedia entries, which would be graded in quality after the study. The
                    results showed that the experimental group yielded more Wikipedia entries
                    and received higher grades in quality. The study concluded that learning
                    with Wikipedia in flipped classrooms was more effective than in conventional
                    classrooms, demonstrating Wikipedia could be used as an educational tool in
                    higher education.

                    look up conditions on the (Wikipedia) site, and some are editing articles
                    themselves to improve the quality of available information." Beck continued
                    to detail in this article new programs of Amin Azzam at the University of
                    San Francisco to offer medical school courses to medical students for
                    learning to edit and improve Wikipedia articles on health-related issues, as
                    well as internal quality control programs within Wikipedia organized by
                    James Heilman to improve a group of 200 health-related articles of central
                    medical importance up to Wikipedia's highest standard of articles using its
                    Featured Article and Good Article peer-review evaluation process. In a May
                    7, 2014, follow-up article in <i>The Atlantic</i> titled "Can Wikipedia Ever
                    Be a Definitive Medical Text?", Julie Beck quotes WikiProject Medicine's
                    James Heilman as stating: "Just because a reference is peer-reviewed doesn't
                    mean it's a high-quality reference." Beck added that: "Wikipedia has its own
                    peer review process before articles can be classified as 'good' or
                    'featured'. Heilman, who has participated in that process before, says 'less
                    than one percent' of Wikipedia's medical articles have passed."

                <p>
                    Wikipedia seeks to create a summary of all human knowledge in the form of an
                    online encyclopedia, with each topic covered encyclopedically in one
                    article. Since it has terabytes of disk space, it can have far more topics
                    than can be covered by any printed encyclopedia. The exact degree and manner
                    of coverage on Wikipedia is under constant review by its editors, and
                    disagreements are not uncommon (see deletionism and inclusionism). Wikipedia
                    contains materials that some people may find objectionable, offensive, or
                    pornographic. The "Wikipedia is not censored" policy has sometimes proved
                    controversial: in 2008, Wikipedia rejected an online petition against the
                    inclusion of images of Muhammad in the English edition of its Muhammad
                    article, citing this policy. The presence of politically, religiously, and
                    pornographically sensitive materials in Wikipedia has led to the censorship
                    of Wikipedia by national authorities in China and Pakistan, among other
                    countries.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Through its "Wikipedia Loves Libraries" program, Wikipedia has partnered
                    with major public libraries such as the New York Public Library for the
                    Performing Arts to expand its coverage of underrepresented subjects and
                    articles. A 2011 study conducted by researchers at the University of
                    Minnesota indicated that male and female editors focus on different coverage
                    topics. There was a greater concentration of females in the "people and
                    arts" category, while males focus more on "geography and science". An
                    editorial in
                    <i>The Guardian</i> in 2014 claimed that more effort went into providing
                    references for a list of female porn actors than a list of women writers.

                <h4>Systemic biases</h4>

                <p>
                    Wikipedia's policies may limit "its capacity for truly representing global
                    knowledge". For example, Wikipedia only considers published sources to be
                    reliable. Oral knowledge of Indigenous cultures is not always reflected in
                    print. Marginalized topics are also more likely to lack significant coverage
                    in reliable sources. Wikipedia's content is therefore limited as a result of
                    larger systemic biases.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Academic studies of Wikipedia have shown that the average contributor to the
                    English Wikipedia is an educated, technically inclined white male, aged
                    15–49, from a developed, predominantly Christian country. The corresponding
                    point of view (POV) is over-represented. This systemic bias in editor
                    demographic results in cultural bias, gender bias, and geographical bias on
                    Wikipedia. There are two broad types of bias, which are
                    <i>implicit</i> (when a topic is omitted) and <i>explicit</i> (when a
                    certain POV is over-represented in an article or by references).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Interdisciplinary scholarly assessments of Wikipedia articles have found
                    that while articles are typically accurate and free of misinformation, they
                    are also typically incomplete and fail to present all perspectives with a
                    neutral point of view. In 2011, Wales claimed that the unevenness of
                    coverage is a reflection of the demography of the editors, citing for
                    example "biographies of famous women through history and issues surrounding
                    early childcare". The October 22, 2013, essay by Tom Simonite in MIT's
                    <i>Technology Review</i> titled "The Decline of Wikipedia" discussed the
                    effect of systemic bias and policy creep on the downward trend in the number
                    of editors.

                    Research conducted by Mark Graham of the Oxford Internet Institute in 2009
                    indicated that the geographic distribution of article topics is highly
                    uneven, with Africa being the most underrepresented. Across 30 language
                    editions of Wikipedia, historical articles and sections are generally
                    Eurocentric and focused on recent events.

                    Wikipedia has been criticized for allowing information about graphic
                    content. Articles depicting what some critics have called objectionable
                    content (such as feces, cadaver, human penis, vulva, and nudity) contain
                    graphic pictures and detailed information easily available to anyone with
                    access to the internet, including children. The site also includes sexual
                    content such as images and videos of masturbation and ejaculation,
                    illustrations of zoophilia, and photos from hardcore pornographic films in
                    its articles. It also has non-sexual photographs of nude children.

                    German rock band Scorpions—features a picture of the album's original cover,
                    which depicts a naked prepubescent girl. The original release cover caused
                    controversy and was replaced in some countries. In December 2008, access to
                    the Wikipedia article <i>Virgin Killer</i> was blocked for four days by most
                    Internet service providers in the United Kingdom after the Internet Watch
                    Foundation (IWF) decided the album cover was a potentially illegal indecent
                    image and added the article's URL to a "blacklist" it supplies to British
                    internet service providers.

                    In April 2010, Sanger wrote a letter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation,
                    outlining his concerns that two categories of images on Wikimedia Commons
                    contained child pornography, and were in violation of US federal obscenity
                    law. Sanger later clarified that the images, which were related to
                    pedophilia and one about lolicon, were not of real children, but said that
                    they constituted "obscene visual representations of the sexual abuse of
                    children", under the PROTECT Act of 2003. That law bans photographic child
                    pornography and cartoon images and drawings of children that are obscene
                    under American law. Sanger also expressed concerns about access to the
                    images on Wikipedia in schools.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Wikimedia Foundation spokesman Jay Walsh strongly rejected Sanger's
                    accusation, saying that Wikipedia did not have "material we would deem to be
                    illegal. If we did, we would remove it." Following the complaint by Sanger,
                    Wales deleted sexual images without consulting the community. After some
                    editors who volunteered to maintain the site argued that the decision to
                    delete had been made hastily, Wales voluntarily gave up some of the powers
                    he had held up to that time as part of his co-founder status. He wrote in a
                    message to the Wikimedia Foundation mailing-list that this action was "in
                    the interest of encouraging this discussion to be about real
                    philosophical/content issues, rather than be about me and how quickly I
                    acted". Critics, including Wikipediocracy, noticed that many of the
                    pornographic images deleted from Wikipedia since 2010 have reappeared.

                <p>
                    One privacy concern in the case of Wikipedia regards one's right to remain a
                    private citizen rather than a public figure in the eyes of the law. It is a
                    battle between the right to be anonymous in cyberspace and the right to be
                    anonymous in real life. The Wikimedia Foundation's privacy policy states,
                    "we believe that you shouldn't have to provide personal information to
                    participate in the free knowledge movement", and states that "personal
                    information" may be shared "For legal reasons", "To Protect You, Ourselves
                    &amp; Others", or "To Understand &amp; Experiment".

                    In January 2006, a German court ordered the German Wikipedia shut down
                    within Germany because it stated the full name of Boris Floricic, aka
                    "Tron", a deceased hacker. On February 9, 2006, the injunction against
                    Wikimedia Deutschland was overturned, with the court rejecting the notion
                    that Tron's right to privacy or that of his parents was being violated.

                    Wikipedia has a "Volunteer Response Team" that uses Znuny, a free and
                    open-source software fork of OTRS to handle queries without having to reveal
                    the identities of the involved parties. This is used, for example, in
                    confirming the permission for using individual images and other media in the

                    Safety Bill legislation. Rebecca MacKinnon of the Wikimedia Foundation said
                    that such checks would run counter to the website's commitment to minimal
                    data collection on its contributors and readers.

                <p>
                    Wikipedia was described in 2015 as harboring a battleground culture of
                    sexism and harassment. The perceived tolerance of abusive language was a
                    reason put forth in 2013 for the gender gap in Wikipedia editorship.
                    Edit-a-thons have been held to encourage female editors and increase the
                    coverage of women's topics.

                <p>
                    In May 2018, a Wikipedia editor rejected a submitted article about Donna
                    Strickland due to lack of coverage in the media. Five months later,
                    Strickland won a Nobel Prize in Physics "for groundbreaking inventions in
                    the field of laser physics", becoming the third woman to ever receive the
                    award. Prior to winning the award, Strickland's only mention on Wikipedia
                    was in the article about her collaborator and co-winner of the award Gérard
                    Mourou. Her exclusion from Wikipedia led to accusations of sexism, but
                    Corinne Purtill writing for <i>Quartz</i> argued that "it's also a pointed
                    lesson in the hazards of gender bias in media, and of the broader
                    consequences of underrepresentation." Purtill attributes the issue to the
                    gender bias in media coverage.

                    <i>Wall Street Journal</i> reported on May 1, 2014, that Tretikov's
                    information technology background, from her years at University of
                    California offers Wikipedia an opportunity to develop in more concentrated
                    directions guided by her often repeated position statement that,
                    "Information, like air, wants to be free." The same
                    <i>Wall Street Journal</i> article reported these directions of development
                    according to an interview with spokesman Jay Walsh of Wikimedia, who "said
                    Tretikov would address that issue (paid advocacy) as a priority. 'We are
                    really pushing toward more transparency ... We are reinforcing that paid
                    advocacy is not welcome.' Initiatives to involve greater diversity of
                    contributors, better mobile support of Wikipedia, new geo-location tools to
                    find local content more easily, and more tools for users in the second and

                    priorities would be the issue of editor harassment endemic to Wikipedia as
                    identified by the Wikipedia board in December. She said to
                    <i>Bloomberg Businessweek</i> regarding the harassment issue that: "It
                    establishes a sense within the community that this is a priority ... [and

                    Wikipedia is also supported by many organizations and groups that are
                    affiliated with the Wikimedia Foundation but independently-run, called
                    Wikimedia movement affiliates. These include Wikimedia chapters (which are
                    national or sub-national organizations, such as Wikimedia Deutschland and
                    Wikimedia France), thematic organizations (such as Amical Wikimedia for the
                    Catalan language community), and user groups. These affiliates participate
                    in the promotion, development, and funding of Wikipedia.

                <p>
                    The operation of Wikipedia depends on MediaWiki, a custom-made, free and
                    open source wiki software platform written in PHP and built upon the MySQL
                    database system. The software incorporates programming features such as a
                    macro language, variables, a transclusion system for templates, and URL
                    redirection. MediaWiki is licensed under the GNU General Public License
                    (GPL) and it is used by all Wikimedia projects, as well as many other wiki
                    projects. Originally, Wikipedia ran on UseModWiki written in Perl by
                    Clifford Adams (Phase I), which initially required CamelCase for article
                    hyperlinks; the present double bracket style was incorporated later.
                    Starting in January 2002 (Phase II), Wikipedia began running on a PHP wiki
                    engine with a MySQL database; this software was custom-made for Wikipedia by
                    Magnus Manske. The Phase II software was repeatedly modified to accommodate
                    the exponentially increasing demand. In July 2002 (Phase III), Wikipedia
                    shifted to the third-generation software, MediaWiki, originally written by
                    Lee Daniel Crocker.

                <p>
                    Several MediaWiki extensions are installed to extend the functionality of
                    the MediaWiki software. In April 2005, a Lucene extension was added to
                    MediaWiki's built-in search and Wikipedia switched from MySQL to Lucene for
                    searching. Lucene was later replaced by CirrusSearch which is based on
                    Elasticsearch. In July 2013, after extensive beta testing, a WYSIWYG (What
                    You See Is What You Get) extension, VisualEditor, was opened to public use.
                    It was met with much rejection and criticism, and was described as "slow and
                    buggy". The feature was changed from opt-out to opt-in afterward.

                <p>
                    Computer programs called bots have often been used to perform simple and
                    repetitive tasks, such as correcting common misspellings and stylistic
                    issues, or to start articles such as geography entries in a standard format
                    from statistical data. One controversial contributor, Sverker Johansson,
                    created articles with his bot Lsjbot, which was reported to create up to
                    10,000 articles on the Swedish Wikipedia on certain days. Additionally,
                    there are bots designed to automatically notify editors when they make
                    common editing errors (such as unmatched quotes or unmatched parentheses).
                    Edits falsely identified by bots as the work of a banned editor can be
                    restored by other editors. An anti-vandal bot is programmed to detect and
                    revert vandalism quickly. Bots are able to indicate edits from particular
                    accounts or IP address ranges, as occurred at the time of the shooting down
                    of the MH17 jet in July 2014 when it was reported that edits were made via
                    IPs controlled by the Russian government. Bots on Wikipedia must be approved
                    before activation. According to Andrew Lih, the current expansion of
                    Wikipedia to millions of articles would be difficult to envision without the
                    use of such bots.

                    As of 2021, page requests are first passed to a front-end layer of Varnish
                    caching servers and back-end layer caching is done by Apache Traffic Server.
                    Requests that cannot be served from the Varnish cache are sent to
                    load-balancing servers running the Linux Virtual Server software, which in
                    turn pass them to one of the Apache web servers for page rendering from the
                    database. The web servers deliver pages as requested, performing page
                    rendering for all the language editions of Wikipedia. To increase speed
                    further, rendered pages are cached in a distributed memory cache until
                    invalidated, allowing page rendering to be skipped entirely for most common
                    page accesses.

                    Wikipedia currently runs on dedicated clusters of Linux servers running the
                    Debian operating system. By January 22, 2013, Wikipedia had migrated its
                    primary data center to an Equinix facility in Ashburn, Virginia. A second
                    application data center was created in 2014 in Carrollton, Texas, to improve
                    Wikipedia's reliability. Both datacenters work as the primary one, in
                    alternate semesters, with the other one working as secondary datacenter. In
                    2017, Wikipedia installed a caching cluster in an Equinix facility in
                    Singapore, the first of its kind in Asia. In 2022, a caching data center was
                    opened in Marseille, France. In 2024, a caching data center was opened in
                    São Paulo, the first of its kind in South America. As of November 2024,
                    caching clusters are located in Amsterdam, San Francisco, Singapore,
                    Marseille, and São Paulo.

                    Following growing amounts of incoming donations in 2013 exceeding seven
                    digits, the Foundation has reached a threshold of assets which qualify its
                    consideration under the principles of industrial organization economics to
                    indicate the need for the re-investment of donations into the internal
                    research and development of the Foundation. Two projects of such internal
                    research and development have been the creation of a Visual Editor and the
                    "Thank" tab in the edit history, which were developed to improve issues of
                    editor attrition. The estimates for reinvestment by industrial organizations
                    into internal research and development was studied by Adam Jaffe, who
                    recorded that the range of 4% to 25% annually was to be recommended, with
                    high-end technology requiring the higher level of support for internal
                    reinvestment. At the 2013 level of contributions for Wikimedia presently
                    documented as 45 million dollars, the computed budget level recommended by
                    Jaffe for reinvestment into internal research and development is between 1.8
                    million and 11.3 million dollars annually. In 2019, the level of
                    contributions were reported by the Wikimedia Foundation as being at $120
                    million annually, updating the Jaffe estimates for the higher level of
                    support to between $3.08 million and $19.2 million annually.

                    Wikipedia editors sometimes struggle to access paywalled sources needed to
                    improve a subject. The Wikipedia Library is a resource for Wikipedia editors
                    which provides free access to a wide range of digital publications, so that
                    they can consult and cite these while editing the encyclopedia. Over 60
                    publishers have partnered with The Wikipedia Library to provide access to
                    their resources: when ICE Publishing joined in 2020, a spokesman said "By
                    enabling free access to our content for Wikipedia editors, we hope to
                    further the research community's resources – creating and updating Wikipedia

                    When the project was started in 2001, all text in Wikipedia was covered by
                    the GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL), a copyleft license permitting the
                    redistribution, creation of derivative works, and commercial use of content
                    while authors retain copyright of their work. The GFDL was created for
                    software manuals that come with free software programs licensed under the
                    GPL. This made it a poor choice for a general reference work: for example,
                    the GFDL requires the reprints of materials from Wikipedia to come with a
                    full copy of the GFDL text. In December 2002, the Creative Commons license
                    was released; it was specifically designed for creative works in general,
                    not just for software manuals. The Wikipedia project sought the switch to
                    the Creative Commons. Because the GFDL and Creative Commons were
                    incompatible, in November 2008, following the request of the project, the
                    Free Software Foundation (FSF) released a new version of the GFDL designed
                    specifically to allow Wikipedia to relicense its content to CC BY-SA by
                    August 1, 2009. In April 2009, Wikipedia and its sister projects held a
                    community-wide referendum which decided the switch in June 2009.

                    The handling of media files (e.g. image files) varies across language
                    editions. Some language editions, such as the English Wikipedia, include
                    non-free image files under fair use doctrine, while the others have opted
                    not to, in part because of the lack of fair use doctrines in their home
                    countries (e.g. in Japanese copyright law). Media files covered by free
                    content licenses (e.g. Creative Commons' CC BY-SA) are shared across
                    language editions via Wikimedia Commons repository, a project operated by
                    the Wikimedia Foundation. Wikipedia's accommodation of varying international
                    copyright laws regarding images has led some to observe that its
                    photographic coverage of topics lags behind the quality of the encyclopedic
                    text. The Wikimedia Foundation is not a licensor of content on Wikipedia or
                    its related projects but merely a hosting service for contributors to and
                    licensors of Wikipedia, a position which was successfully defended in 2004
                    in a court in France.

                    Obtaining the full contents of Wikipedia for reuse presents challenges,

                    dump available of Wikipedia's images. Wikimedia Enterprise is a for-profit

                    for concern and worry. The article in <i>The New York Times</i> reported the

                    readership of the English-language Wikipedia comes via mobile devices, a
                    figure substantially lower than the percentage of mobile traffic for other

                    editing has lagged even more." In 2014 <i>The New York Times</i> reported
                    that Möller has assigned "a team of 10 software developers focused on
                    mobile", out of a total of approximately 200 employees working at the
                    Wikimedia Foundation. One principal concern cited by
                    <i>The New York Times</i> for the "worry" is for Wikipedia to effectively
                    address attrition issues with the number of editors which the online
                    encyclopedia attracts to edit and maintain its content in a mobile access
                    environment. By 2023, the Wikimedia Foundation's staff had grown to over 700
                    employees.

                    Access to Wikipedia from mobile phones was possible as early as 2004,
                    through the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), via the Wapedia service. In
                    June 2007, Wikipedia launched en.mobile.wikipedia.org, an official website
                    for wireless devices. In 2009, a newer mobile service was officially
                    released, located at en.m.wikipedia.org, which caters to more advanced
                    mobile devices such as the iPhone, Android-based devices, or WebOS-based
                    devices. Several other methods of mobile access to Wikipedia have emerged
                    since. Many devices and applications optimize or enhance the display of
                    Wikipedia content for mobile devices, while some also incorporate additional
                    features such as use of Wikipedia metadata like geoinformation.

                    The Android app for Wikipedia was released in January 2012, to over 500,000
                    installs and generally positive reviews, scoring over four of a possible
                    five in a poll of approximately 200,000 users downloading from Google. The
                    version for iOS was released on April 3, 2013, to similar reviews. Wikipedia
                    Zero was an initiative of the Wikimedia Foundation to expand the reach of
                    the encyclopedia to the developing countries by partnering with mobile
                    operators to allow free access. It was discontinued in February 2018 due to
                    lack of participation from mobile operators.

                    Andrew Lih and Andrew Brown both maintain editing Wikipedia with smartphones
                    is difficult and this discourages new potential contributors. Lih states
                    that the number of Wikipedia editors has been declining after several years,
                    and Tom Simonite of

                    a factor in this. Simonite alleges some Wikipedians use the labyrinthine
                    rules and guidelines to dominate others and those editors have a vested
                    interest in keeping the status quo. Lih alleges there is a serious
                    disagreement among existing contributors on how to resolve this. Lih fears
                    for Wikipedia's long-term future while Brown fears problems with Wikipedia
                    will remain and rival encyclopedias will not replace it.

                    In February 2014, <i>The New York Times</i> reported that Wikipedia was
                    ranked fifth globally among all websites, stating "With 18 billion page
                    views and nearly 500 million unique visitors a month, ... Wikipedia trails
                    just Yahoo, Facebook, Microsoft and Google, the largest with 1.2 billion
                    unique visitors." However, its ranking dropped to 13th globally by June 2020
                    due mostly to a rise in popularity of Chinese websites for online shopping.
                    The website has since recovered its ranking as of April 2022.

                    In addition to logistic growth in the number of its articles, Wikipedia has
                    steadily gained status as a general reference website since its inception in
                    2001. The number of readers of Wikipedia worldwide reached 365 million at
                    the end of 2009. The Pew Internet and American Life project found that one
                    third of US Internet users consulted Wikipedia. In 2011,
                    <i>Business Insider</i> gave Wikipedia a valuation of $4 billion if it ran
                    advertisements.

                    Wikipedia readers visit the site more than five times a month, and a similar
                    number of readers specifically look for Wikipedia in search engine results.
                    About 47 percent of Wikipedia readers do not realize that Wikipedia is a

                    During the COVID-19 pandemic, Wikipedia's coverage of the pandemic and fight
                    against misinformation received international media attention, and brought
                    an increase in Wikipedia readership overall. Noam Cohen wrote in
                    <i>Wired</i> that Wikipedia's effort to combat misinformation related to the
                    pandemic was different from other major websites, opining, "Unless Twitter,
                    Facebook and the others can learn to address misinformation more
                    effectively, Wikipedia will remain the last best place on the Internet." In
                    October 2020, the World Health Organization announced they were freely
                    licensing its infographics and other materials on Wikimedia projects. There
                    were nearly 7,000 COVID-19 related Wikipedia articles across 188 different
                    Wikipedias, as of November 2021.

                    Wikipedia's content has also been used in academic studies, books,
                    conferences, and court cases. The Parliament of Canada's website refers to
                    Wikipedia's article on same-sex marriage in the "related links" section of
                    its "further reading" list for the
                    <i>Civil Marriage Act</i>. The encyclopedia's assertions are increasingly
                    used as a source by organizations such as the US federal courts and the
                    World Intellectual Property Organization—though mainly for supporting
                    information rather than information decisive to a case. Content appearing on
                    Wikipedia has also been cited as a source and referenced in some US
                    intelligence agency reports. In December 2008, the scientific journal
                    <i>RNA Biology</i> launched a new section for descriptions of families of
                    RNA molecules and requires authors who contribute to the section to also
                    submit a draft article on the RNA family for publication in Wikipedia.
                    Wikipedia has also been used as a source in journalism, often without
                    attribution, and several reporters have been dismissed for plagiarizing from
                    Wikipedia.

                    collaboration and interaction by millions of people worldwide. On September
                    16, 2007, <i>The Washington Post</i> reported that Wikipedia had become a
                    focal point in the 2008 US election campaign, saying: "Type a candidate's
                    name into Google, and among the first results is a Wikipedia page, making
                    those entries arguably as important as any ad in defining a candidate.
                    Already, the presidential entries are being edited, dissected and debated
                    countless times each day." An October 2007 Reuters article, titled
                    "Wikipedia page the latest status symbol", reported the recent phenomenon of
                    how having a Wikipedia article vindicates one's notability.

                    One of the first times Wikipedia was involved in a governmental affair was
                    on September 28, 2007, when Italian politician Franco Grillini raised a
                    parliamentary question with the minister of cultural resources and
                    activities about the necessity of freedom of panorama. He said that the lack
                    of such freedom forced Wikipedia, "the seventh most consulted website", to
                    forbid all images of modern Italian buildings and art, and claimed this was
                    hugely damaging to tourist revenues.

                    called Wikipedia "the best-known example of crowdsourcing ... that far

                    In a 2017 opinion piece for <i>Wired</i>, Hossein Derakhshan describes
                    Wikipedia as "one of the last remaining pillars of the open and
                    decentralized web" and contrasted its existence as a text-based source of
                    knowledge with social media and social networking services, the latter
                    having "since colonized the web for television's values". For Derakhshan,
                    Wikipedia's goal as an encyclopedia represents the Age of Enlightenment
                    tradition of rationality triumphing over emotions, a trend which he
                    considers "endangered" due to the "gradual shift from a typographic culture
                    to a photographic one, which in turn mean[s] a shift from rationality to
                    emotions, exposition to entertainment". Rather than "<i>sapere aude</i>"
                    (lit.&thinsp;'dare to know'), social networks have led to a culture of "dare
                    not to care to know". This is while Wikipedia faces "a more concerning
                    problem" than funding, namely "a flattening growth rate in the number of
                    contributors to the website". Consequently, the challenge for Wikipedia and
                    those who use it is to "save Wikipedia and its promise of a free and open
                    collection of all human knowledge amid the conquest of new and old
                    television—how to collect and preserve knowledge when nobody cares to know."

                    Ars Electronica contest; this came with a €10,000 (£6,588; $12,700) grant
                    and an invitation to present at the PAE Cyberarts Festival in Austria later
                    that year. The second was a Judges' Webby Award for the "community"
                    category.

                    The most obvious economic effect of Wikipedia has been the death of
                    commercial encyclopedias, especially printed versions like
                    <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i>, which were unable to compete with a free
                    alternative. Nicholas Carr's 2005 essay "The amorality of Web 2.0"
                    criticizes websites with user-generated content (like Wikipedia) for
                    possibly leading to professional (and, in his view, superior) content
                    producers' going out of business, because "free trumps quality all the
                    time". Carr wrote, "Implicit in the ecstatic visions of Web 2.0 is the
                    hegemony of the amateur. I for one can't imagine anything more frightening."
                    Others dispute the notion that Wikipedia, or similar efforts, will entirely
                    displace traditional publications. Chris Anderson, the former
                    editor-in-chief of <i>Wired</i>, wrote in <i>Nature</i> that the "wisdom of
                    crowds" approach of Wikipedia will not displace top scientific journals with
                    rigorous peer review processes.

                    Wikipedia's influence on the biography publishing business has been a
                    concern for some. Book publishing data tracker Nielsen BookScan stated in
                    2013 that biography sales were dropping "far more sharply". Kathryn Hughes,
                    professor of life writing at the University of East Anglia and author of two
                    biographies wrote, "The worry is that, if you can get all that information
                    from Wikipedia, what's left for biography?"

                    Wikipedia has been widely used as a corpus for linguistic research in
                    computational linguistics, information retrieval and natural language
                    processing. In particular, it commonly serves as a target knowledge base for
                    the entity linking problem, which is then called "wikification", and to the
                    related problem of word-sense disambiguation. Methods similar to
                    wikification can in turn be used to find "missing" links in Wikipedia.

                    In 2015, French researchers José Lages of the University of Franche-Comté in
                    Besançon and Dima Shepelyansky of Paul Sabatier University in Toulouse
                    published a global university ranking based on Wikipedia scholarly
                    citations. They used PageRank, CheiRank and similar algorithms "followed by
                    the number of appearances in the 24 different language editions of Wikipedia
                    (descending order) and the century in which they were founded (ascending
                    order)". The study was updated in 2019.

                    In December 2015, John Julius Norwich stated, in a letter published in
                    <i>The Times</i> newspaper, that as a historian he resorted to Wikipedia "at
                    least a dozen times a day", and had "never caught it out". He described it
                    as "a work of reference as useful as any in existence", with so wide a range
                    that it is almost impossible to find a person, place, or thing that it has
                    left uncovered and that he could never have written his last two books
                    without it.

                    A 2017 MIT study suggests that words used in Wikipedia articles end up in
                    scientific publications. Studies related to Wikipedia have been using
                    machine learning and artificial intelligence to support various operations.
                    One of the most important areas is the automatic detection of vandalism and
                    data quality assessment in Wikipedia.

                    Several interactive multimedia encyclopedias incorporating entries written
                    by the public existed long before Wikipedia was founded. The first of these
                    was the 1986 BBC Domesday Project, which included text (entered on BBC Micro
                    computers) and photographs from more than a million contributors in the UK,
                    and covered the geography, art, and culture of the UK. This was the first
                    interactive multimedia encyclopedia (and was also the first major multimedia
                    document connected through internal links), with the majority of articles
                    being accessible through an interactive map of the UK. The user interface
                    and part of the content of the Domesday Project were emulated on a website
                    until 2008.

                <p>
                    Several free-content, collaborative encyclopedias were created around the
                    same period as Wikipedia (e.g. Everything2), with many later being merged
                    into the project (e.g. GNE). One of the most successful early online
                    encyclopedias incorporating entries by the public was h2g2, which was
                    created by Douglas Adams in 1999. The h2g2 encyclopedia is relatively
                    lighthearted, focusing on articles which are both witty and informative.

                    Subsequent collaborative knowledge websites have drawn inspiration from
                    Wikipedia. Others use more traditional peer review, such as
                    <i>Encyclopedia of Life</i> and the online wiki encyclopedias
                    <i>Scholarpedia</i> and Citizendium. The latter was started by Sanger in an
                    attempt to create a reliable alternative to Wikipedia.
