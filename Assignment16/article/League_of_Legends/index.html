                    <i><b>League of Legends</b></i> (<i><b>LoL</b></i>), commonly referred to as <i><b>League</b></i>,
                    is a multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published
                    by Riot Games. Inspired by <i>Defense of the Ancients</i>, a custom map for
                    <i>Warcraft III</i>, Riot's founders sought to develop a stand-alone game in
                    the same genre. Since its release in October 2009, <i>League</i> has been
                    free-to-play and is monetized through purchasable character customization.
                    The game is available for Windows and macOS.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In the game's main mode, Summoner's Rift, two teams of five players battle
                    in player-versus-player combat. Each player controls a character, known as a
                    "champion", with unique abilities and styles of play. During a match,
                    champions become more powerful by collecting experience points, earning
                    gold, and purchasing items to defeat the opposing team. Teams defend their
                    base and win by pushing toward the enemy base and destroying a large
                    structure within it, the "Nexus".
                </p>

                <p>
                    <i>League of Legends</i> has received generally favorable reviews, which
                    have highlighted its accessibility, character designs, and production value.
                    The game's long lifespan has resulted in a critical reappraisal, with
                    reviews trending favorably; it is widely considered one of the greatest
                    video games ever made. But rude and abusive in-game player behavior,
                    criticized since the game's early days, persists despite Riot's attempts to
                    fix the problem. In 2019, <i>League</i> regularly peaked at eight million
                    concurrent players, and its popularity has led to tie-ins such as music,
                    comic books, short stories, and the animated series <i>Arcane</i>. Its
                    success has spawned several spin-off video games, including a mobile
                    version, a digital collectible card game, and a turn-based role-playing
                    game, among others. A massively multiplayer online role-playing game based
                    on the property is in development.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <i>League of Legends</i> is the world's largest esport, with an
                    international competitive scene consisting of multiple regional leagues
                    which culminates in an annual <i>League of Legends</i> World Championship.
                    The 2019 event registered over 100 million unique viewers, peaking at a
                    concurrent viewership of 44 million during the finals. Domestic and
                    international events have been broadcast on livestreaming websites such as
                    Twitch, YouTube, Bilibili, and the cable television sports channel ESPN.

                <p>
                    <i>League of Legends</i> is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game in
                    which the player controls a character ("champion") with a set of unique
                    abilities from an isometric perspective. During a match, champions gain
                    levels by accruing experience points (XP) through killing enemies. Items can
                    be acquired to increase champions' strength, and are bought with gold, which
                    players accrue passively over time and earn actively by defeating the
                    opposing team's minions, champions, or defensive structures. In the main
                    game mode, Summoner's Rift, items are purchased through a shop menu
                    available to players only when their champion is in the team's base. Each
                    match is discrete; levels and items do not transfer from one match to
                    another.
                </p>

                <h3 id="Summoner's_Rift">Summoner's Rift</h3>

                <p>
                    Summoner's Rift is the flagship game mode of <i>League of Legends</i> and
                    the most prominent in professional-level play. The mode has a ranked
                    competitive ladder; a matchmaking system determines a player's skill level
                    and generates a starting rank from which they can climb. There are ten
                    tiers; the least skilled are Iron, Bronze, and Silver, and the highest are
                    Master, Grandmaster, and Challenger.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Two teams of five players compete to destroy the opposing team's "Nexus",
                    which is guarded by the enemy champions and defensive structures known as
                    "turrets". Each team's Nexus is in its base, where players start the game
                    and reappear after death. Non-player characters known as minions are
                    generated from each team's Nexus and advance toward the enemy base along
                    three lanes guarded by turrets: top, middle, and bottom. Each team's base
                    contains three "inhibitors", one behind the third tower from the center of
                    each lane. Destroying an enemy team's inhibitor causes stronger allied
                    minions to spawn in that lane and allows the attacking team to damage the
                    enemy Nexus and the two turrets guarding it. The regions in between the
                    lanes are known as the "jungle", which is inhabited by "monsters" that, like
                    minions, respawn at regular intervals. Like minions, monsters provide gold
                    and XP when killed. Another, more powerful class of monster resides within
                    the river that separates each team's jungle. These monsters require multiple
                    players to defeat and grant special abilities to their slayers' team. For
                    example, teams can gain a powerful allied unit after killing the Rift
                    Herald, permanent strength boosts by killing dragons, and stronger, more
                    durable minions by killing Baron Nashor.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Summoner's Rift matches can last from 15 minutes to over an hour. The game
                    does not dictate where players may go, but conventions have arisen:
                    typically one player goes in the top lane, one in the middle lane, one in
                    the jungle, and two in the bottom lane. Players in a lane kill minions to
                    accumulate gold and XP (termed "farming") and try to prevent their opponent
                    from doing the same. A fifth champion, known as a "jungler", farms the
                    jungle monsters and, when powerful enough, assists their teammates in a
                    lane.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Besides Summoner's Rift, <i>League of Legends</i> has two other permanent
                    game modes. ARAM ("All Random, All Mid") is a five-versus-five mode like
                    Summoner's Rift, but on a map called Howling Abyss with only one long lane,
                    no jungle area, and champions randomly chosen for players. Given the small
                    size of the map, players must be vigilant in avoiding enemy abilities.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <i>Teamfight Tactics</i> is an auto battler released in June 2019 and made a
                    permanent game mode the next month. As with others in its genre, players
                    build a team and battle to be the last one standing. Players do not directly
                    affect combat but position their units on a board for them to fight
                    automatically against opponents each round. <i>Teamfight Tactics</i> is
                    available for iOS and Android and has cross-platform play with the Windows
                    and macOS clients.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Other game modes have been made available temporarily, typically aligning
                    with in-game events. Ultra Rapid Fire (URF) mode was available for two weeks
                    as a 2014 April Fools Day prank. In the mode, champion abilities have no
                    resource cost, significantly reduced cooldown timers, increased movement
                    speed, reduced healing, and faster attacks. In April 2015, Riot disclosed
                    that it had not brought the mode back because its unbalanced design resulted
                    in player "burnout". Riot also said the costs associated with maintaining
                    and balancing URF were too high. Other temporary modes include One for All
                    and Nexus Blitz. One for All has players pick a champion for all members of
                    their team to play. In Nexus Blitz, players participated in a series of
                    mini-games on a compressed map.

                    Riot Games's founders Brandon Beck and Marc Merill had an idea for a
                    spiritual successor to <i>Defense of the Ancients</i>, known as <i>DotA</i>.
                    A mod for <i>Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos</i>, <i>DotA</i> required players
                    to buy <i>Warcraft III</i> and install custom software;
                    <i>The Washington Post</i>'s Brian Crecente said the mod "lacked a level of
                    polish and was often hard to find and set up". Phillip Kollar of
                    <i>Polygon</i> noted that Blizzard Entertainment supported
                    <i>Warcraft III</i> with an expansion pack, then shifted their focus to
                    other projects while the game still had players. Beck and Merill sought to
                    create a game that would be supported over a significantly longer period.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Beck and Merill held a <i>DotA</i> tournament for students at the University
                    of Southern California, with an ulterior goal of recruitment. There they met
                    Jeff Jew, later a producer on <i>League of Legends</i>. Jew was very
                    familiar with <i>DotA</i> and spent much of the tournament teaching others
                    how to play. Beck and Merill invited him to an interview, and he joined Riot
                    Games as an intern. Beck and Merill recruited two figures involved with
                    <i>DotA:</i> Steve Feak, one of its designers, and Steve Mescon, who ran a
                    support website to assist players. Feak said early development was highly
                    iterative, comparing it to designing <i>DotA</i>.

                    A demonstration of <i>League of Legends</i> built in the
                    <i>Warcraft III</i> game engine was completed in four months and then shown
                    at the 2007 Game Developers Conference. There, Beck and Merill had little
                    success with potential investors. Publishers were confused by the game's
                    free-to-play business model and lack of a single-player mode. The
                    free-to-play model was untested outside of Asian markets, so publishers were
                    primarily interested in a retail release, and the game's capacity for a
                    sequel. In 2008, Riot reached an agreement with holding company Tencent to
                    oversee the game's launch in China.

                <p>
                    <i>League of Legends</i> was announced on October 7, 2008, for Microsoft
                    Windows. Closed beta-testing began in April 2009. Upon the launch of the
                    beta, 17 champions were available. Riot initially aimed to ship the game
                    with 20 champions but doubled the number before the game's full release in
                    North America on October 27, 2009. The game's full name was announced as
                    <i>League of Legends: Clash of Fates</i>. Riot planned to use the subtitle
                    to signal when future content was available, but decided it was silly and
                    dropped it before launch.

                <p>
                    <i>League of Legends</i> receives regular updates in the form of patches.
                    Although previous games had utilized patches to ensure no one strategy
                    dominated, <i>League of Legends</i>' patches made keeping pace with the
                    developer's changes a core part of the game. In 2014, Riot standardized its
                    patch cadence to once approximately every two or three weeks. These updates
                    change the effectiveness of strategies within the game, known as the
                    metagame; update content is determined by the developer using a combination
                    of gameplay data and product goals.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The development team includes hundreds of game designers and artists. In
                    2016, the music team had four full-time composers and a team of producers
                    creating audio for the game and its promotional materials. As of 2025, the
                    game has 172 champions, and Riot Games periodically overhauls the visuals
                    and gameplay of the oldest in the roster. Although only available for
                    Microsoft Windows at launch, a Mac version of the game was made available in
                    2013.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Since May 2023, the game uses Riot's custom always-online anti-cheat
                    software, Vanguard, on Microsoft Windows devices. Originally developed by
                    Riot for its tactical shooter <i>Valorant</i> (2020), Vanguard requires
                    access to the device's kernel, which some users saw as unnecessarily
                    intrusive. Vanguard does not collect user data or send it to Riot Games.
                    Following the anti-cheat's deployment, some players said Vanguard bricked
                    their devices. The developer said this was caused by other problems, with
                    only 0.03% of players reporting issues.

                <h3 id="Revenue_model">Revenue model</h3>

                <p>
                    <i>League of Legends</i> uses a free-to-play business model. Revenue is
                    generated by selling cosmetic goods with no impact to gameplay. Several of
                    these cosmetics—for example, "skins" that change the appearance of
                    champions—can be redeemed after purchasing an in-game currency called Riot
                    Points (RP). As virtual goods, they have high profit margins. An Ubisoft
                    analyst estimated in 2014 that 4% of players were paying
                    customers—significantly lower than the industry standard—and suggested that
                    revenue optimization was likely not a priority because of the game's large
                    player base. A 2016 analysis by SuperData estimated the game's monthly
                    revenues at $150 million per month. At the 2024 Summer Game Fest, game
                    director Pu Liu said that revenue is primarily generated by a "single-digit
                    percentage" of players, colloquially known as whales.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Skins have five basic tiers, ranging in cost from $4 to $25. Riot Games
                    added an additional skin tier to <i>League of Legends</i> in 2024,
                    describing them as a luxury good. These skins cannot be purchased outright:
                    instead, players buy attempts to win the skin via a slot machine. Some
                    commentators identified this as a gacha game mechanic, used by Riot since
                    2023 in <i>Teamfight Tactics</i>. Players are guaranteed to acquire the skin
                    after a predefined number of failed attempts. The cost can range from $200
                    to $430. Responses to early skins in this tier divided players. The first
                    was criticized for being a recolored variant of an existing skin, known as a
                    "chroma". The developer released several more of these, with a YouTube
                    content creator known for showcasing upcoming skins for the company
                    describing the tier as a "scam".
                </p>

                <p>
                    One day after revealing a $430 "Hall of Fame" skin to honor the career of
                    professional gamer Faker, Riot announced layoffs at the company, impacting
                    Ben Rosado—the cosmetic's designer—and eliciting further negative responses
                    from players. In early 2025, Riot announced a new skin in the tier that had
                    been long requested by players. <i>PC Gamer</i>'s Rick Lane described the
                    strategy as "whale chasing" and "psychological manipulation". He said that
                    the skins had been selected to "subtly" entice players into "rolling the
                    dice", at which point the sunk-cost fallacy takes over. Lane described it as
                    the latest in a series of monetization controversies for the developer.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In November 2024, the studio said they would streamline player rewards in an
                    upcoming patch, describing the game's various progression tracks and
                    currencies as "needlessly complex". The announcement caused widespread
                    outrage. A viral Reddit post estimated that free-to-play players must play
                    the game for over 800 hours to unlock a single champion. It was described by
                    <i>GamesRadar+</i> as the studio's "worst PR disaster in years". In
                    mid-January 2025, game director Andrei van Room said they had "screwed up",
                    explaining that a designer forgot to include the "first win of the day"
                    experience bonus in their calculations, causing unintended consequences. The
                    developer partially reverted some of the changes, including halving the cost
                    of purchasing a champion, and the return of "hextech chests"—a loot box
                    system introduced in 2016. These are purchasable virtual "chests" that
                    provide random cosmetics, a practice that has been criticized as a form of
                    gambling.

                <h3 id="Plot">Plot</h3>

                <p>
                    Before 2014, players existed in-universe as political leaders, or
                    "Summoners", commanding champions to fight on the Fields of Justice—for
                    example, Summoner's Rift—to avert a catastrophic war. Sociologist Matt
                    Watson said the plot and setting were bereft of the political themes found
                    in other role-playing games, and presented in reductive "good versus evil"
                    terms. In the game's early development, Riot did not hire writers, and
                    designers wrote character biographies only a paragraph long.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In September 2014, Riot Games rebooted the game's fictional setting,
                    removing summoners from the game's lore to avoid "creative stagnation". Luke
                    Plunkett wrote for <i>Kotaku</i> that, although the change would upset
                    long-term fans, it was necessary as the game's player base grew in size.
                    Shortly after the reboot, Riot hired <i>Warhammer</i> writer Graham McNeill.
                    Riot's storytellers and artists create flavor text, adding "richness" to the
                    game, but very little of this is seen as a part of normal gameplay. Instead,
                    that work supplies a foundation for the franchise's expansion into other
                    media, such as comic books and spin-off video games. The Fields of Justice
                    were replaced by a new fictional setting—a planet called Runeterra. The
                    setting has elements from several genres—from Lovecraftian horror to
                    traditional sword and sorcery fantasy.

                <h2 id="Reception">Reception</h2>

                <p>
                    <i>League of Legends</i> received generally favorable reviews on its initial
                    release, according to review aggregator website Metacritic. Many
                    publications noted the game's high replay value. <i>Kotaku</i> reviewer
                    Brian Crecente admired how items altered champion play styles. Quintin Smith
                    of <i>Eurogamer</i> concurred, praising the amount of experimentation
                    offered by champions. Comparing it to <i>Defense of the Ancients</i>, Rick
                    McCormick of <i>GamesRadar+</i> said that playing
                    <i>League of Legends</i> was "a vote for choice over refinement".
                </p>

                <p>
                    Given the game's origins, other reviewers frequently compared aspects of it
                    to <i>DotA.</i>
                    According to
                    <i>GamesRadar+</i> and <i>GameSpot</i>, <i>League of Legends</i> would feel
                    familiar to those who had already played <i>DotA</i>. The game's inventive
                    character design and lively colors distinguished the game from its
                    competitors. Smith concluded his review by noting that, although there was
                    not "much room for negativity", Riot's goal of refining <i>DotA</i> had not
                    yet been realized.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Although Crecente praised the game's free-to-play model, <i>GameSpy</i>'s
                    Ryan Scott was critical of the grind required for non-paying players to
                    unlock key gameplay elements, calling it unacceptable in a competitive game.
                    Many outlets said the game was underdeveloped. A physical version of the
                    game was available for purchase from retailers; <i>GameSpot</i>'s Kevin
                    VanOrd said it was an inadvisable purchase because the value included $10 of
                    store credit for an unavailable store. German site <i>GameStar</i> noted
                    that none of the bonuses in that version were available until the launch
                    period had ended and refused to carry out a full review. <i>IGN</i>'s Steve
                    Butts compared the launch to the poor state of <i>CrimeCraft</i>'s release
                    earlier in 2009; he indicated that features available during
                    <i>League of Legends</i>' beta were removed for the release, even for those
                    who purchased the retail version. Matches took unnecessarily long to find
                    for players, with long queue times, and <i>GameRevolution</i> mentioned
                    frustrating bugs.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Some reviewers addressed toxicity in the game's early history. Crecente
                    wrote that the community was "insular" and "whiny" when losing. Butts
                    speculated that <i>League of Legends</i> inherited many of <i>DotA</i>'s
                    players, who had developed a reputation for being "notoriously hostile" to
                    newcomers.

                <h3 id="Reassessment">Reassessment</h3>

                <p>
                    Regular updates to the game have resulted in a reappraisal by some outlets;
                    <i>IGN</i>'s second reviewer, Leah B. Jackson, explained that the website's
                    original review had become "obsolete". Two publications increased their
                    original scores: <i>GameSpot</i> from 6 to 9, and <i>IGN</i> from 8 to 9.2.
                    The variety offered by the champion roster was described by Steven Strom of
                    <i>PC Gamer</i> as "fascinating"; Jackson pointed to "memorable" characters
                    and abilities. Although the items had originally been praised at release by
                    other outlets such as <i>Kotaku</i>, Jackson's reassessment criticized the
                    lack of item diversity and viability, noting that the items recommended to
                    the player by the in-game shop were essentially required because of their
                    strength.
                </p>

                <p>
                    While reviewers were pleased with the diverse array of play styles offered
                    by champions and their abilities, Strom thought that the female characters
                    still resembled those in "horny <i>Clash of Clans</i> clones" in 2018. Two
                    years before Strom's review, a champion designer responded to criticism by
                    players that a young, female champion was not conventionally attractive. He
                    argued that limiting female champions to one body type was constraining and
                    said progress had been made in Riot's recent releases.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Comparisons persisted between the game and others in the genre.
                    <i>GameSpot</i>'s Tyler Hicks wrote that new players would pick up
                    <i>League of Legends</i> quicker than <i>DotA</i> and that the removal of
                    randomness-based skills made the game more competitive. Jackson called
                    <i>League of Legends</i>'s rate of unlock for champions "a model of
                    generosity", but less than <i>DotA</i>'s sequel, <i>Dota 2</i> (2013),
                    produced by Valve, wherein characters are unlocked by default. Strom said
                    the game was fast-paced compared to <i>Dota 2</i>'s "yawning" matches, but
                    slower than those of Blizzard Entertainment's "intentionally accessible"
                    MOBA <i>Heroes of the Storm</i> (2015).

                <p>
                    At the first Game Developers Choice Awards in 2010, the game won four major
                    awards: Best Online Technology, Game Design, New Online Game, and Visual

                    Music produced for the game won a Shorty Award, and was nominated at the

                    <i>League of Legends</i> has received awards for its contribution to
                    esports. It was nominated for Best Esports Game at The Game Awards in 2017
                    and 2018, then won in 2019, 2020, and 2021. Specific events organized by
                    Riot for esports tournaments have been recognized by awards ceremonies. Also
                    at The Game Awards, the Riot won Best Esports Event for the 2019, 2020 and
                    2021 <i>League</i> World Championships. At the 39th Sports Emmy Awards in
                    2018, <i>League of Legends</i> won Outstanding Live Graphic Design for the
                    2017 world championship; as part of the pre-competition proceedings, Riot
                    used augmented reality technology to have a computer-generated dragon fly
                    across the stage.

                <h2 id="Player_behavior">Player behavior</h2>

                <p>
                    <i>League of Legends</i>'s player base has a longstanding reputation for
                    "toxicity"—rude and abusive in-game behavior, with a survey by the
                    Anti-Defamation League indicating that 76% of players have experienced
                    in-game harassment. Riot Games has acknowledged the problem and responded
                    that only a small portion of the game's players are consistently toxic.
                    According to Jeffrey Lin, Riot's lead designer of social systems, most bad
                    behavior is committed by players "occasionally acting out". Several major
                    systems have been implemented to tackle the issue. One is basic report
                    functionality; players can report teammates or opponents who violate the
                    game's code of ethics. The in-game chat is also monitored by algorithms that
                    detect several types of abuse. An early system was the "Tribunal"—players
                    who met certain requirements were able to review reports sent to Riot. If
                    enough players determined that the messages were a violation, an automated
                    system would punish them. Lin said that eliminating toxicity was an
                    unrealistic goal, and the focus should be on rewarding good behavior. To
                    that end, Riot reworked the "Honor system" in 2017, allowing players to
                    award teammates virtual medals after games for one of three positive
                    attributes. Acquiring these medals increases a player's "Honor level",
                    rewarding them with free loot boxes over time.

                <p>
                    <i>League of Legends</i> is one of the world's largest esports, described by
                    <i>The New York Times</i> as its "main attraction". Online viewership and
                    in-person attendance for the game's esports events outperformed those of the
                    National Basketball Association, the World Series, and the Stanley Cup in
                    2016. For the 2019 and 2020 <i>League of Legends</i> World Championship
                    finals, Riot Games reported 44 and 45 peak million concurrent viewers
                    respectively. <i>Harvard Business Review</i> said that
                    <i>League of Legends</i>
                    epitomized the birth of the esports industry.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As of April 2021, Riot Games operates 12 regional leagues internationally,
                    four of which—China, Europe, Korea, and North America—have franchised
                    systems. In 2017, this system comprised 109 teams and 545 players. League
                    games are typically livestreamed on platforms such as Twitch and YouTube.
                    The company sells streaming rights to the game; the North American league
                    playoff is broadcast on cable television by sports network ESPN. In China,
                    the rights to stream international events such as the World Championships
                    and the Mid-Season Invitational were sold to Bilibili in Fall 2020 for a
                    three-year deal reportedly worth US$113 million, while exclusive streaming
                    rights for the domestic and other regional leagues are owned by Huya Live.
                    The game's highest-paid professional players have commanded salaries of
                    above $1 million—over three times the highest-paid players of
                    <i>Overwatch</i>. The scene has attracted investment from businesspeople
                    otherwise unassociated with esports, such as retired basketball player Rick
                    Fox, who founded his own team. In 2020, his team's slot in the North
                    American league was sold to the Evil Geniuses organization for $33 million.

                    For the 10th anniversary of <i>League of Legends</i> in 2019, Riot Games
                    announced several games at various stages of production that were directly
                    related to the <i>League of Legends</i> intellectual property (IP). A
                    stand-alone version of <i>Teamfight Tactics</i> was announced for mobile
                    operating systems iOS and Android at the event and released in March 2020.
                    The game has cross-platform play with the Windows and macOS clients.
                    <i>Legends of Runeterra,</i> a free-to-play digital collectible card game,
                    launched in April 2020 for Microsoft Windows; the game features characters
                    from <i>League of Legends</i>. <i>League of Legends: Wild Rift</i> is a
                    version of the game for mobile operating systems Android and iOS. Instead of
                    porting the game from <i>League of Legends</i>, <i>Wild Rift</i>'s character
                    models and environments were entirely rebuilt. A single-player, turn-based
                    role-playing game, <i>Ruined King: A League of Legends Story</i>, was
                    released in 2021 for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series
                    X/S, Nintendo Switch, and Windows. It was the first title released under
                    Riot Games's publishing arm, Riot Forge, wherein non-Riot studios develop
                    games using <i>League of Legends</i> characters. In December 2020, Greg
                    Street, vice-president of IP and Entertainment at Riot Games, announced that
                    a massively multiplayer online role-playing game based on the game is in
                    development. <i>Song of Nunu: A League of Legends Story</i>, a third-person
                    adventure game revolving around the champion Nunu's search for his mother,
                    with the help of the yeti Willump, was announced for a planned release in
                    2022. It is being developed by Tequila Works, the creators of <i>Rime</i>.
                    It was released on Windows and the Nintendo Switch on November 1, 2023.

                <p>
                    Riot Games's first venture into music was in 2014 with the virtual heavy
                    metal band Pentakill, promoting a skin line of the same name. Initially,
                    Pentakill consisted of six champions: Kayle, Karthus, Mordekaiser, Olaf,
                    Sona, and Yorick. In 2021, Viego was introduced to the group. Their music
                    was primarily made by Riot Games's in-house music team but featured cameos
                    by Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee and Danny Lohner, a former member of
                    industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails. Their second album,
                    <i>Grasp of the Undying</i>, reached number one on the iTunes metal charts
                    in 2017.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Pentakill was followed by K/DA, a virtual K-pop girl group composed of four
                    champions, Ahri, Akali, Evelynn, and Kai'sa. As with Pentakill, K/DA is
                    promotional material for a skin line by the same name. The group's debut
                    single, "Pop/Stars", which premiered at the 2018
                    <i>League of Legends</i> World Championship, garnered over 400 million views
                    on YouTube and sparked widespread interest from people unfamiliar with
                    <i>League of Legends</i>. In August 2020, Riot Games released "The Baddest",
                    the pre-release single for <i>All Out</i>, the five-track EP from K/DA which
                    followed in November that year.

                <p>
                    In 2019, Riot created a virtual hip hop group called True Damage, featuring
                    the champions Akali, Yasuo, Qiyana, Senna, and Ekko. The vocalists—Keke
                    Palmer, Thutmose, Becky G, Duckwrth, and Soyeon—performed a live version of
                    the group's debut song, "Giants", during the opening ceremony of the 2019
                    <i>League of Legends</i> World Championship, alongside holographic versions
                    of their characters. The in-game cosmetics promoted by the music video
                    featured a collaboration with fashion house Louis Vuitton.

                <p>
                    In 2023, Riot formed Heartsteel, a virtual boy band, comprising the
                    champions Aphelios, Ezreal, Kayn, K'Sante, Sett, and Yone. The vocalists are
                    Baekhyun from the K-pop groups Exo and SuperM, Cal Scruby, ØZI, and Tobi
                    Lou. Heartsteel's debut single "Paranoia" was released in October of that
                    year.

                <p>
                    Riot announced a collaboration with Marvel Comics in 2018. Riot had
                    previously experimented with releasing comics through its website. Shannon
                    Liao of <i>The Verge</i> noted that the comic books were "a rare opportunity
                    for Riot to showcase its years of lore that has often appeared as an
                    afterthought". The first comic was <i>League of Legends: Ashe—Warmother</i>,
                    which debuted in 2018, followed by <i>League of Legends: Lux</i> that same
                    year. A print version of the latter was released in 2019.

                <h3 id="Arcane"><i>Arcane</i></h3>

                <p>
                    While celebrating <i>League of Legends</i>'s tenth anniversary, Riot
                    announced an animated television series, <i>Arcane.</i> It was the company's
                    first production for television, and a collaboration between Riot Games and
                    animation studio Fortiche Production. The series is set in the
                    technologically advanced city of Piltover and its oppressed, underground
                    sister city of Zaun. <i>Arcane</i> explores adult themes and is not intended
                    for children. It features multiple playable characters from
                    <i>League of Legends</i>. Hailee Steinfeld stars as Vi, Ella Purnell as
                    Jinx, Kevin Alejandro as Jayce, and Katie Leung as Caitlyn.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After a delay caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the series premiered in
                    November 2021 on Netflix internationally and through Tencent Video in China.
                    The first season received critical acclaim, winning four Emmy Awards and
                    nine Annie Awards. After the success of the first season, Riot hired former
                    executives from Netflix, HBO Max, and Paramount Television Studios to expand
                    its entertainment division, and CEO Nicolo Laurent pledged to create an
                    "entertainment company for the 21st century". Ahead of the premiere of the
                    second and final season, <i>Variety</i> reported that production and
                    marketing costs for <i>Arcane</i>'s 18 episodes exceeded $250 million,
                    making it the most expensive animated series ever made.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <i>Bloomberg News</i> reported that Riot paid Netflix around $3 million for
                    each episode aired and that the studio failed to convert the series' success
                    into in-game revenue. Riot had no plan to recoup the show's costs but said
                    the second season was "on track to break even". The second season premiered
                    in November 2024 to similar acclaim, winning seven Annie Awards in all
                    nominated categories. GKIDS produced home media releases of the first season
                    in 2024, including a collector's edition DVD, a 4K UHD steelbook, and
                    Blu-ray variants. As of 2025, home media releases for the second season are
                    forthcoming.
